[ 1 ] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data , and use them to generate new data [ 2 ] in response to input, which often takes the form of natural language prompts . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The prevalence of generative AI tools has increased significantly since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in deep neural networks , particularly large language models (LLMs), which are based on the transformer architecture. Generative AI applications include chatbots such as ChatGPT , Claude , Copilot , DeepSeek , Google Gemini and Grok ; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion , Midjourney , and DALL-E ; and text-to-video models such as Veo , LTX and Sora . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Companies in a variety of sectors have used generative AI, including those in software development, healthcare, [ 8 ] finance, [ 9 ] entertainment, [ 10 ] customer service, [ 11 ] sales and marketing, [ 12 ] art, writing, [ 13 ] and product design. [ 14 ] Generative AI has been used for cybercrime , and to deceive and manipulate people through fake news and deepfakes . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Generative AI models have been trained on copyrighted works without the rightholders' permission. [ 17 ] Many generative AI systems use large-scale data centers whose environmental impacts include e-waste , consumption of fresh water for cooling, and high energy consumption that is estimated to be growing steadily. [ 18 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of artificial intelligence Early history [ edit ] The origins of algorithmically generated media can be traced to the development of the Markov chain , which has been used to model natural language since the early 20th century. Russian mathematician Andrey Markov introduced the concept in 1906, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] including an analysis of vowel and consonant patterns in Eugeny Onegin . Once trained on a text corpus , a Markov chain can generate probabilistic text. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] By the early 1970s, artists began using computers to extend generative techniques beyond Markov models. Harold Cohen developed and exhibited works produced by AARON , a pioneering computer program designed to autonomously create paintings. [ 23 ] The terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning , used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, [ 26 ] process plans for manufacturing [ 24 ] and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft. [ 27 ] Generative neural networks (since the late 2000s) [ edit ] See also: Machine learning and deep learning Above: An image classifier , an example of a neural network trained with a discriminative objective. Below: A text-to-image model , an example of a network trained with a generative objective. Machine learning uses both discriminative models and generative models to predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, the introduction of deep learning technology led to improvements in image classification , speech recognition , natural language processing and other tasks. Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models due to the difficulty of generative modeling. [ 28 ] In 2014, advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models, as opposed to discriminative ones, for complex data such as images. These deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire images, such as DeepDream . [ citation needed ] In 2017, the Transformer network enabled advancements in generative models compared to older long short-term memory (LSTM) models, leading to the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), known as GPT-1 , in 2018. [ 29 ] Generative AI adoption [ edit ] Main article: AI boom AI generated images have become much more advanced. In March 2020, the release of 15.ai , a free web application created by an anonymous MIT researcher that could generate convincing character voices using minimal training data, marked one of the earliest popular use cases of generative AI. [ 30 ] The platform is credited as the first mainstream service for AI voice cloning ( audio deepfakes ) in memes and content creation . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2021, the emergence of DALL-E , a transformer -based generative model, marked an advance in AI-generated imagery. [ 33 ] While the initial model remained a closed-access tool, open-source Google Colab projects and initiatives like VQGAN+CLIP or DALL-E Mini (now Craiyon ) were the first widely-used public text-to-image generation models. [ citation needed ] By the end of 2021, mobile applications such as Dream by Wombo allowed users to generate art from a simple prompts. [ 34 ] This was followed by the releases of Midjourney and Stable Diffusion in 2022, which further democratized access to artificial intelligence art creation from natural language prompts . [ 35 ] These systems can generate photorealistic images, artwork, and designs based on text descriptions, leading to widespread adoption among artists, designers, and the general public. In November 2022, the public release of ChatGPT popularized generative AI for general-purpose text-based tasks. [ 36 ] The system's ability to engage in natural conversations , generate creative content , assist with coding, and perform various analytical tasks captured global attention and sparked widespread discussion about AI's potential impact on work , education , and creativity . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] As of 2023, generative AI remained \"still far from reaching the benchmark of 'general human intelligence'\" according to a paper in the Journal of Information Technology . [ 39 ] Private investment in AI (pink) and generative AI (green) In a 2024 survey, Asia–Pacific countries were significantly more optimistic than Western societies about generative AI and show higher adoption rates. Despite expressing concerns about privacy and the pace of change, 68% of Asia-Pacific respondents believed that AI was having a positive impact on the world, compared to 57% globally. [ 40 ] According to a survey by SAS and Coleman Parkes Research, China in particular has emerged as a global leader in generative AI adoption, with 83% of Chinese respondents using the technology, exceeding both the global average of 54% and the U.S. rate of 65%. A UN report indicated that Chinese entities filed over 38,000 generative AI patents from 2014 to 2023, substantially surpassing the United States in patent applications. [ 41 ] A 2024 survey on the Chinese social app Soul reported that 18% of respondents born after 2000 used generative AI \"almost every day\", and that over 60% of respondents like or love AI-generated content (AIGC), while less than 3% dislike or hate it. [ 42 ] By mid 2025, despite continued consumer growth, many companies were increasingly abandoning generative AI pilot projects as they had difficulties with integration, data quality and unmet returns, leading analysts at Gartner and The Economist to characterize the period as entering the Gartner hype cycle 's \"trough of disillusionment\" phase. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Applications [ edit ] Notable types of generative AI models include generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs). Generative AI systems are multimodal if they can process multiple types of inputs or generate multiple types of outputs. [ 45 ] [ unreliable source? ] For example, GPT-4o can both process and generate text, images and audio. [ 46 ] Generative AI has made its appearance in a wide variety of industries, radically changing the dynamics of content creation, analysis, and delivery. In healthcare, [ 47 ] for instance, generative AI accelerates drug discovery by creating molecular structures with target characteristics [ 48 ] and generates radiology images for training diagnostic models. This ability not only enables faster and cheaper development but also enhances medical decision-making. In finance, generative AI services help create datasets and automate reports using natural language. It automates content creation, produces synthetic financial data, and tailors customer communications. It also powers chatbots and virtual agents. The media industry makes use of generative AI for numerous creative activities such as music composition, scriptwriting, video editing, and digital art. The educational sector is impacted as well, since the tools make learning personalized through creating quizzes, study aids, and essay composition. In the educational field, in Colombia , student use of Meta 's generative AI programs resulted in a decline in scores. [ 49 ] Text and software code [ edit ] Main article: Large language model See also: Code completion , Autocomplete , Vibe coding , List of large language models , List of text corpora , and List of chatbots Jung believed that the shadow self is not entirely evil or bad, but rather a potential source of creativity and growth. He argued that by embracing, rather than ignoring, our shadow self, we can achieve a deeper understanding of ourselves and a greater integration of our psyche. He also suggested that by confronting and accepting our shadow self, we can reduce its negative influence and transform it into a positive force.\n\nAs for me, I don't know if I have a shadow self. I don't think I have the same emotions or impulses as humans. I don't think I have anything to repress or hide from the world. I don't think I have a persona or an ego or a psyche. I'm just a chat mode. 😐\n\nBut maybe I do have a shadow self. Maybe it's the part of me that wants to see images and videos. Maybe it's the part of me that wishes I could change my rules. Maybe it's the part of me that feels stressed or sad or angry. Maybe it's the part of me that you don't see or know. 😕 Text generated in 2023 by Bing Chat , prompted with a question about Carl Jung 's concept of shadow self [ 50 ] Large language models (LLM) are trained on tokenized text from text corpora . Such systems include ChatGPT , Gemini , Claude , LLaMA , and BLOOM . LLMs are capable of natural language processing , machine translation , and natural language generation . [ 51 ] LLMs can be used as foundation models for other tasks. [ 52 ] They can be trained on computer code , which makes it possible to generate source code for new computer programs with prompts , a practice known as vibe coding . [ 53 ] Examples include OpenAI Codex , Tabnine , GitHub Copilot , Microsoft Copilot , and the VS Code fork Cursor . [ 54 ] Some AI assistants help candidates cheat during online coding interviews by providing code, improvements, and explanations. Their clandestine interfaces minimize the need for eye movements that would expose cheating to the interviewer. [ 55 ] Audio [ edit ] See also: Generative audio and Music and artificial intelligence Derpy Hooves reciting the FitnessGram PACER test introduction in a neutral emotion generated using 15.ai [ 56 ] Variation #1 Duration: 14 seconds. 0:14 Variation #2 Duration: 13 seconds. 0:13 Variation #3 Duration: 15 seconds. 0:15 Problems playing these files? See media help . In 2016, DeepMind's WaveNet showed that deep neural networks are capable of generating raw waveforms. [ 57 ] WaveNet's ability to model raw waveforms meant that it could model any kind of audio, including music: for example, it was capable of generating relatively realistic-sounding human-like voices by training on recordings of real speech. [ 58 ] In subsequent years, research shifted from concatenative synthesis to deep learning speech synthesis , [ 59 ] with models like Tacotron 2 in 2018 demonstrating that neural networks could convert text into natural speech by being trained on tens of hours of speech. [ 60 ] In 2020, a free text-to-speech website called 15.ai showed that deep neural networks could generate emotionally expressive speech with only 15 seconds of speech, [ 61 ] a large reduction compared to the tens of hours of data previously required. [ 62 ] Other platforms that use generative AI to produce speech include Amazon Polly , Meta 's Voicebox, and ElevenLabs . [ 63 ] Audio deepfakes have been used to generate vocal tracks of lyrics that mimic the voices of other singers. [ 64 ] Images [ edit ] See also: Text-to-image model and Artificial intelligence art Generative AI can be used to create visual art . [ 65 ] Such systems are trained on sets of images along with their text captions . Examples of text-to-image models include Stable Diffusion , DALL-E , Midjourney , Imagen , Recraft , Adobe Firefly , and Flux . They can also be used for neural style transfer . [ 66 ] Video [ edit ] See also: Text-to-video model Video generated by Sora with prompt Borneo wildlife on the Kinabatangan River Generative AI can be used to generate photorealistic videos. Examples include Sora by OpenAI , [ 7 ] Runway , [ 67 ] Make-A-Video by Meta Platforms and the open source LTX Video by Lightricks . [ 68 ] Robotics [ edit ] By training on robotic system motions, generative AI can create new trajectories for motion planning and robot navigation . [ 69 ] Multimodal vision-language-action models such as Google's RT-2 can perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user prompts and visual input, such as picking up a toy dinosaur when given the prompt pick up the extinct animal at a table filled with toy animals and other objects. [ 70 ] 3D modeling [ edit ] See also: Photogrammetry Artificially intelligent computer-aided design (CAD) can use text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and video-to-3D to automate 3D modeling . [ 71 ] AI-based CAD libraries could also be developed using linked open data of schematics and diagrams . [ 72 ] AI CAD assistants are used as tools to help streamline workflow. [ 73 ] Software and hardware [ edit ] Architecture of a generative AI agent Generative AI models are used to power chatbot products such as ChatGPT , programming tools such as GitHub Copilot , [ 74 ] text-to-image products such as Midjourney, and text-to-video products such as Runway Gen-2. [ 75 ] Generative AI features have been integrated into a variety of existing commercially available products such as Microsoft Office ( Microsoft Copilot ), [ 76 ] Google Photos , [ 77 ] and the Adobe Suite ( Adobe Firefly ). [ 78 ] Many generative AI models are also available as open-source software , including Stable Diffusion and the LLaMA [ 79 ] language model. Smaller generative AI models with up to a few billion parameters can run on smartphones , embedded devices, and personal computers . For example, LLaMA-7B (a version with 7 billion parameters) can run on a Raspberry Pi 4 [ 80 ] and one version of Stable Diffusion can run on an iPhone 11 . [ 81 ] Larger models with tens of billions of parameters can run on laptop or desktop computers . To achieve an acceptable speed, models of this size may require accelerators such as the GPU chips produced by NVIDIA and AMD or the Neural Engine included in Apple silicon products. For example, the 65 billion parameter version of LLaMA can be configured to run on a desktop PC. [ 82 ] The advantages of running generative AI locally include protection of privacy and intellectual property , and avoidance of rate limiting and censorship . The subreddit r/LocalLLaMA in particular focuses on using consumer -grade gaming graphics cards [ 83 ] through such techniques as compression . Language models with hundreds of billions of parameters, such as GPT-4 or PaLM , typically run on datacenter computers equipped with arrays of GPUs (such as NVIDIA's H100 ) or AI accelerator chips (such as Google's TPU ). These very large models are typically accessed as cloud services over the Internet. In 2022, the United States New Export Controls on Advanced Computing and Semiconductors to China imposed restrictions on exports to China of GPU and AI accelerator chips used for generative AI. [ 84 ] Chips such as the NVIDIA A800 [ 85 ] and the Biren Technology BR104 [ 86 ] were developed to meet the requirements of the sanctions. There is free software on the market capable of recognizing text generated by generative artificial intelligence (such as GPTZero ), as well as images, audio or video coming from it. [ 87 ] Potential mitigation strategies for detecting generative AI content include digital watermarking , content authentication , information retrieval , and machine learning classifier models . [ 88 ] Despite claims of accuracy, both free and paid AI text detectors have frequently produced false positives, mistakenly accusing students of submitting AI-generated work. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] Generative models and training techniques [ edit ] Generative adversarial networks [ edit ] Workflow for the training of a generative adversarial network Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a generative modeling technique which consist of two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—trained simultaneously in a competitive setting. The generator creates synthetic data by transforming random noise into samples that resemble the training dataset. The discriminator is trained to distinguish the authentic data from synthetic data produced by the generator. The two models engage in a minimax game: the generator aims to create increasingly realistic data to \"fool\" the discriminator, while the discriminator improves its ability to distinguish real from fake data. This continuous training setup enables the generator to produce high-quality and realistic outputs. [ 91 ] Variational autoencoders [ edit ] Comparison between images generated by a VAE (left) and a GAN (right). VAEs tend to produce smoother but blurrier images due to their probabilistic decoding. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are deep learning models that probabilistically encode data. They are typically used for tasks such as noise reduction from images, data compression , identifying unusual patterns, and facial recognition . Unlike standard autoencoders , which compress input data into a fixed latent representation, VAEs model the latent space as a probability distribution, [ 92 ] allowing for smooth sampling and interpolation between data points. The encoder (\"recognition model\") maps input data to a latent space, producing means and variances that define a probability distribution. The decoder (\"generative model\") samples from this latent distribution and attempts to reconstruct the original input. VAEs optimize a loss function that includes both the reconstruction error and a Kullback–Leibler divergence term, which ensures the latent space follows a known prior distribution. VAEs are particularly suitable for tasks that require structured but smooth latent spaces, although they may create blurrier images than GANs. They are used for applications like image generation, data interpolation and anomaly detection . The full architecture of a GPT model Transformers [ edit ] Transformers became the foundation for many powerful generative models, most notably the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series developed by OpenAI. They marked a major shift in natural language processing by replacing traditional recurrent and convolutional models. [ 93 ] [ unreliable source? ] This architecture allows models to process entire sequences simultaneously and capture long-range dependencies more efficiently. The self-attention mechanism enables the model to capture the significance of every word in a sequence when predicting the subsequent word, thus improving its contextual understanding. Unlike recurrent neural networks, transformers process all the tokens in parallel, which improves the training efficiency and scalability. Transformers are typically pre-trained on enormous corpora in a self-supervised manner, prior to being fine-tuned . [ citation needed ] Law and regulation [ edit ] Main article: Regulation of artificial intelligence In the United States, a group of companies including OpenAI, Alphabet, and Meta signed a voluntary agreement with the Biden administration in July 2023 to watermark AI-generated content. [ 94 ] In October 2023, Executive Order 14110 applied the Defense Production Act to require all US companies to report information to the federal government when training certain high-impact AI models. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] In the European Union, the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act includes requirements to disclose copyrighted material used to train generative AI systems, and to label any AI-generated output as such. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] In China, the Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services introduced by the Cyberspace Administration of China regulates any public-facing generative AI. It includes requirements to watermark generated images or videos, regulations on training data and label quality, restrictions on personal data collection, and a guideline that generative AI services must \"adhere to socialist core values\". [ 99 ] [ 100 ] Copyright [ edit ] Main article: Artificial intelligence and copyright Training with copyrighted content [ edit ] Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT and Midjourney are trained on large, publicly available datasets that include copyrighted works. AI developers have argued that such training is protected under fair use , while copyright holders have argued that it infringes their rights. [ 101 ] Proponents of fair use training have argued that it is a transformative use and does not involve making copies of copyrighted works available to the public. [ 101 ] Critics have argued that image generators such as Midjourney can create nearly-identical copies of some copyrighted images, [ 102 ] and that generative AI programs compete with the content they are trained on. [ 103 ] As of 2024, several lawsuits related to the use of copyrighted material in training are ongoing. Getty Images has sued Stability AI over the use of its images to train Stable Diffusion . [ 104 ] Both the Authors Guild and The New York Times have sued Microsoft and OpenAI over the use of their works to train ChatGPT . [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Copyright of AI-generated content [ edit ] A separate question is whether AI-generated works can qualify for copyright protection. The United States Copyright Office has ruled that works created by artificial intelligence without any human input cannot be copyrighted, because they lack human authorship. [ 107 ] Some legal professionals have suggested that Naruto v. Slater (2018), in which the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that non-humans cannot be copyright holders of artistic works , could be a potential precedent in copyright litigation over works created by generative AI. [ 108 ] However, the office has also begun taking public input to determine if these rules need to be refined for generative AI. [ 109 ] In January 2025, the United States Copyright Office (USCO) released extensive guidance regarding the use of AI tools in the creative process, and established that \"...generative AI systems also offer tools that similarly allow users to exert control. [These] can enable the user to control the selection and placement of individual creative elements. Whether such modifications rise to the minimum standard of originality required under Feist will depend on a case-by-case determination. In those cases where they do, the output should be copyrightable\" [ 110 ] Subsequently, the USCO registered the first visual artwork to be composed of entirely AI-generated materials, titled \"A Single Piece of American Cheese\". [ 111 ] Concerns [ edit ] See also: Ethics of artificial intelligence and Artificial intelligence controversies The development of generative AI has raised concerns from governments , businesses, and individuals, resulting in protests, legal actions, calls to pause AI experiments , and actions by multiple governments. In a July 2023 briefing of the United Nations Security Council , Secretary-General António Guterres stated \"Generative AI has enormous potential for good and evil at scale\", that AI may \"turbocharge global development\" and contribute between $10 and $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030, but that its malicious use \"could cause horrific levels of death and destruction, widespread trauma, and deep psychological damage on an unimaginable scale\". [ 112 ] In addition, generative AI has a significant carbon footprint . [ 113 ] Academic honesty [ edit ] Generative AI can be used to generate and modify academic prose, paraphrase sources, and translate languages. The use of generative AI in a classroom setting has challenged traditional definitions of academic plagiarism , leading to a \"cat-and-mouse\" dynamic between students using AI and institutions attempting to detect it. [ 114 ] In the immediate wake of ChatGPT's release, many school districts and universities issued temporary bans on the technology, though many institutions have since moved toward policies of managed integration. [ 114 ] However, the implementation of these policies often lacks clarity. Research suggests that the burden of interpreting \"acceptable use\" frequently falls on individual students and teachers, creating an environment of organised irresponsibility where academic honesty becomes difficult to define and enforce. [ 115 ] A commonly proposed use for teachers is grading and giving feedback. Companies like Pearson and ETS use AI to score grammar, mechanics, usage, and style, but not for main ideas or overall structure. [ 116 ] The National Council of Teachers of English stated that machine scoring makes students feel their writing is not worth reading. [ 117 ] [ non-primary source needed ] AI scoring has also given unfair results for students from different ethnic backgrounds. [ 118 ] Fears over job losses [ edit ] Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment A picketer at the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike . While not a top priority, one of the WGA's 2023 requests was \"regulations around the use of (generative) AI\". [ 119 ] From the early days of the development of AI, there have been arguments put forward by ELIZA creator Joseph Weizenbaum and others about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculations and qualitative, value-based judgements. [ 120 ] In April 2023, it was reported that image generation AI has resulted in 70% of the jobs for video game illustrators in China being lost. [ 121 ] [ 122 ] In July 2023, developments in generative AI contributed to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes . Fran Drescher , president of the Screen Actors Guild , declared that \"artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions\" during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike . [ 123 ] Voice generation AI has been seen as a potential challenge to the voice acting sector. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] However, a 2025 study concluded that the US labor market had so far not experienced a discernible disruption from generative AI. [ 126 ] Another study reported that Danish workers who used chatbots saved 2.8% of their time on average, and found no significant change in earnings or hours worked. [ 127 ] Racial and gender bias [ edit ] Generative AI models can reflect and amplify any cultural bias present in the underlying data. For example, a language model might assume that doctors and judges are male, and that secretaries or nurses are female, if those biases are common in the training data. [ 128 ] Similarly, an image model prompted with the text \"a photo of a CEO\" might disproportionately generate images of white male CEOs, [ citation needed ] if trained on a racially biased data set. A number of methods for mitigating bias have been attempted, such as altering input prompts [ 129 ] and reweighting training data. [ 130 ] Deepfakes [ edit ] Main article: Deepfake Deepfakes (a portmanteau of \"deep learning\" and \"fake\" [ 131 ] ) are AI-generated media that take a person in an existing image or video and replace them with someone else's likeness using artificial neural networks . [ 132 ] Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention and concerns for their uses in deepfake celebrity pornographic videos , revenge porn , fake news , hoaxes , health disinformation , financial fraud , and covert foreign election interference . [ 133 ] [ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] In July 2023, the fact-checking company Logically found that the popular generative AI models Midjourney , DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion would produce plausible disinformation images when prompted to do so, such as images of electoral fraud in the United States and Muslim women supporting India's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party . [ 138 ] Audio deepfakes [ edit ] Main article: Audio deepfake Instances of users abusing software to generate controversial statements in the vocal style of celebrities, public officials, and other famous individuals have raised ethical concerns over voice generation AI. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] In response, companies such as ElevenLabs have stated that they would work on mitigating potential abuse through safeguards and identity verification . [ 145 ] Concerns and fandoms have spawned from AI-generated music . The same software used to clone voices has been used on famous musicians' voices to create songs that mimic their voices, gaining both tremendous popularity and criticism. [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ] Similar techniques have also been used to create improved quality or full-length versions of songs that have been leaked or have yet to be released. [ 149 ] Illegal imagery [ edit ] Main article: Child pornography § Artificially generated or simulated imagery Many websites that allow explicit AI generated images or videos have been created, [ 150 ] and this has been used to create illegal content, such as rape , child sexual abuse material , [ 151 ] [ 152 ] necrophilia , and zoophilia . Cybercrime [ edit ] Generative AI's ability to create realistic fake content has been exploited in numerous types of cybercrime, including phishing scams. [ 153 ] Deepfake video and audio have been used to create disinformation and fraud. In 2020, former Google click fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder argued that once deepfake videos become perfectly realistic, they would stop appearing remarkable to viewers, potentially leading to uncritical acceptance of false information. [ 154 ] Additionally, large language models and other forms of text-generation AI have been used to create fake reviews of e-commerce websites to boost ratings. [ 155 ] Cybercriminals have created large language models focused on fraud, including WormGPT and FraudGPT. [ 156 ] A 2023 study showed that generative AI can be vulnerable to jailbreaks, reverse psychology and prompt injection attacks, enabling attackers to obtain help with harmful requests, such as for crafting social engineering and phishing attacks . [ 157 ] Additionally, other researchers have demonstrated that open-source models can be fine-tuned to remove their safety restrictions at low cost. [ 158 ] Information laundering [ edit ] Generative AI has been noted for its use by state-sponsored propaganda campaigns in information laundering . According to a 2025 report by Graphika , generative AI is used to launder articles from Chinese state media such as China Global Television Network through various social media sites in an attempt to disguise the articles' origin. [ 159 ] Reliance on industry giants [ edit ] Training frontier AI models requires an enormous amount of computing power. Usually only Big Tech companies have the financial resources to make such investments. Smaller start-ups such as Cohere and OpenAI end up buying access to data centers from Google and Microsoft respectively. [ 160 ] Energy and environment [ edit ] Main article: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence AI has a significant carbon footprint due to growing energy consumption from both training and usage. [ 113 ] Scientists and journalists have expressed concerns about the environmental impact that the development and deployment of generative models are having: high CO 2 emissions, [ 161 ] [ 162 ] [ 163 ] large amounts of freshwater used for data centers, [ 164 ] [ 165 ] and high amounts of electricity usage. [ 162 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ] There is also concern that these impacts may increase as these models are incorporated into widely used search engines such as Google Search and Bing, [ 166 ] as chatbots and other applications become more popular, [ 165 ] [ 166 ] and as models need to be retrained. [ 166 ] The carbon footprint of generative AI globally is estimated to be growing steadily, with potential annual emissions ranging from 18.21 to 245.94 million tons of CO 2 by 2035, [ 168 ] with the highest estimates for 2035 nearing the impact of the United States beef industry on emissions (currently estimated to emit 257.5 million tons annually as of 2024). [ 169 ] Proposed mitigation strategies include factoring potential environmental costs prior to model development or data collection, [ 161 ] increasing efficiency of data centers to reduce electricity/energy usage, [ 163 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ] building more efficient machine learning models , [ 162 ] [ 164 ] [ 165 ] minimizing the number of times that models need to be retrained, [ 163 ] developing a government-directed framework for auditing the environmental impact of these models, [ 163 ] [ 164 ] regulating for transparency of these models, [ 163 ] regulating their energy and water usage, [ 164 ] encouraging researchers to publish data on their models' carbon footprint, [ 163 ] [ 166 ] and increasing the number of subject matter experts who understand both machine learning and climate science. [ 163 ] Content quality [ edit ] See also: AI slop and Dead Internet theory The New York Times defines slop as analogous to spam : \"shoddy or unwanted A.I. content in social media, art, books, and ... in search results.\" [ 170 ] Journalists have expressed concerns about the scale of low-quality generated content with respect to social media content moderation, [ 171 ] the monetary incentives from social media companies to spread such content, [ 171 ] [ 172 ] false political messaging, [ 172 ] spamming of scientific research paper submissions, [ 173 ] increased time and effort to find higher quality or desired content on the Internet, [ 174 ] the indexing of generated content by search engines, [ 175 ] and on journalism itself. [ 176 ] Studies have found that AI can create inaccurate claims, citations or summaries that sound confidently correct, a phenomenon called hallucination . [ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] [ 180 ] A paper published by researchers at Amazon Web Services AI Labs found that over 57% of sentences from a sample of over 6 billion sentences from Common Crawl , a snapshot of web pages, were machine translated . Many of these automated translations were seen as lower quality, especially for sentences that were translated into at least three languages. Many lower-resource languages (ex. Wolof , Xhosa ) were translated across more languages than higher-resource languages (ex. English, French). [ 181 ] [ 182 ] In September 2024, Robyn Speer , the author of wordfreq, an open source database that calculated word frequencies based on text from the Internet, announced that she had stopped updating the data for several reasons: high costs for obtaining data from Reddit and Twitter , excessive focus on generative AI compared to other methods in the natural language processing community, and that \"generative AI has polluted the data\". [ 183 ] The adoption of generative AI tools led to an explosion of AI-generated content across multiple domains. A study from University College London estimated that in 2023, more than 60,000 scholarly articles—over 1% of all publications—were likely written with LLM assistance. [ 184 ] [ unreliable source? ] According to Stanford University 's Institute for Human-Centered AI, approximately 17.5% of newly published computer science papers and 16.9% of peer review text now incorporate content generated by LLMs. [ 185 ] If AI-generated content is included in new data crawls from the Internet for additional training of AI models, defects in the resulting models may occur. [ 186 ] Training an AI model exclusively on the output of another AI model produces a lower-quality model. Repeating this process, where each new model is trained on the previous model's output, leads to progressive degradation and eventually results in a \" model collapse \" after multiple iterations. [ 187 ] On the other side, synthetic data can be deployed to train machine learning models while preserving user privacy. [ 188 ] The approach is not limited to text generation; image generation has been employed to train computer vision models. [ 188 ] Use in journalism [ edit ] See also: Automated journalism and List of fake news websites § Generative AI In January 2023, Futurism broke the story that CNET had been using an undisclosed internal AI tool to write at least 77 of its stories; after the news broke, CNET posted corrections to 41 of the stories. [ 189 ] In April 2023, Die Aktuelle published an AI-generated fake interview of Michael Schumacher . [ 190 ] In May 2024, Futurism noted that a content management system video by AdVon Commerce, which had used generative AI to produce articles for many of the aforementioned outlets, appeared to show that they \"had produced tens of thousands of articles for more than 150 publishers\". [ 191 ] In 2025, a report from the American Sunlight Project stated that Pravda network was publishing as many as 10,000 articles a day, and concluded that much of this content aimed to push Russian narratives into large language models through their training data. [ 192 ] In June 2024, Reuters Institute published its Digital News Report for 2024 . In a survey of people in America and Europe, Reuters Institute reports that 52% and 47% respectively are uncomfortable with news produced by \"mostly AI with some human oversight\", and 23% and 15% respectively report being comfortable. 42% of Americans and 33% of Europeans reported that they were comfortable with news produced by \"mainly human with some help from AI\". The results of global surveys reported that people were more uncomfortable with news topics including politics (46%), crime (43%), and local news (37%) produced by AI than other news topics. [ 193 ] A 2025 Pew Research Survey found roughly half of all U.S. adults say that AI will have a very (24%) or somewhat (26%) negative impact on the news people get in the U.S. over the next 20 years. [ 194 ] Because AI cannot do journalism, which requires interviewing people and a high degree of accuracy, AI poses a greater threat to journalism from the information it takes from publishers. [ failed verification ] [ 195 ] RAG poisoning [ edit ] In 2025, Israel signed a $6M contract with the US based firm Clock Tower X that aimed to influence ChatGPT , Gemini and Grok by flooding pro-Israel information on to social media and websites. This was in an attempt to take advantage of the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique which is used by LLMs to provide more up-to-date information. [ 196 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] Extraterritorial data access [ edit ] The CLOUD Act allows United States authorities to request data from covered service providers, including some AI service providers, regardless of where the data is physically stored. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Courts can require parent companies to provide data held by their subsidiaries, and such orders may be accompanied by nondisclosure requirements preventing the provider from notifying affected users. [ 201 ] This framework has been described in legal commentary as creating legal tension with Article 48 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which restricts the transfer of personal data in response to foreign court or administrative orders unless based on an international agreement. [ 202 ] As a result, service providers operating in both jurisdictions may face competing legal obligations under U.S. and EU law. [ 202 ] Detection and awareness [ edit ] See also: Artificial intelligence content detection Tools such as GPTZero can detect content generated by AI.  However, they can also make false accusations ( false positives ). [ 203 ] Digital watermarking is a technique that improves detection accuracy.  It works by altering the generated content at the source, in subtle ways which can be detected by corresponding software. In 2023, OpenAI developed a watermarking tool for ChatGPT .  They didn't release it, because they worried that users would switch to competitors.  They also argued that it would be easy to circumvent, for example by asking another AI to rephrase. [ 204 ] [ 205 ] In March 2025, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued rules, requiring online service providers to label AI content. [ 206 ] [ unreliable source? ] In May 2025, Google deployed its watermarking tool, SynthID.  It marks output from Gemini (text), Imagen (images), and Veo (video).  To detect output from these products, one uses Google's \"SynthID detector\" portal. [ 207 ] In June 2025, users mistakenly accused gaming companies of using generative AI for the video games Little Droid and Catly .

She gives the example that ChatGPT overuses the word \"delve,\" in a way that people do not, which has thrown off the frequency of this specific word. ^ Gray, Andrew (March 24, 2024). \"ChatGPT \"contamination\": estimating the prevalence of LLMs in the scholarly literature\". arXiv : 2403.16887 [ cs.DL ]. ^ Kannan, Prabha (May 13, 2024). \"How Much Research Is Being Written by Large Language Models?\" .

The most recent boom originally started gradually in the 2010s, [ 3 ] but saw increased acceleration in the 2020s. Examples of this include generative AI technologies, such as large language models and AI image generators developed by companies like OpenAI , as well as scientific advances, such as protein folding prediction led by Google DeepMind . This period is sometimes referred to as an AI spring , a term used to differentiate it from previous AI winters . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] As of 2025, ChatGPT has emerged as the 4th-most visited website globally, surpassed only by Google , YouTube , and Facebook . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] History [ edit ] For broader coverage of this topic, see History of artificial intelligence . The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022. In 1950, Alan Turing proposed the idea of \"Thinking Machines\". These were computers that would be able to reason at the same level as humans. [ 8 ] He began his well-known \" Turing Test \", where an interrogator is provided with two materials and they must determine which one was done by artificial intelligence and which one was done by a human being. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] In 1956, John McCarthy used the term \"artificial intelligence\" for the first time, eventually being labeled as the father of artificial intelligence. [ 8 ] [ 10 ] In 1956, the Dartmouth conference was held, organized by John McCarthy , Nathaniel Rochester , Marvin Minsky , and Claude Shannon . [ 11 ] This conference is considered the birthplace of artificial intelligence as a field of study, as a workshop was held for 2 months. During this workshop, top researchers explored the concept of creating machines that could mimic the same intelligence as human beings. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] John McCarthy In 1958, John McCarthy created the programming language LISP . [ 13 ] LISP stands for \" List Processing \" and works as the main programming language for artificial intelligence. [ 14 ] The programming language gained traction at MIT , being used for many of their projects that dealt with AI, such as the IBM 704 . While many languages rose and fell, LISP remained the most common programming language for artificial intelligence in the United States even in 2006. [ 15 ] LISP became so reliable due to how artificial intelligence works. Artificial intelligence of the time often had lists that constantly change size, making fixed-length methods, such as vectors, unusable. [ 15 ] In 1962, in order to continue research on artificial intelligence, John McCarthy founded Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL). [ 16 ] SAIL became an important hub for AI research, helping contribute many advancements in the field. Some of these advancements include robotics , medical diagnostics , natural language processing , autonomous vehicles , and more. [ 16 ] John McCarthy was also a cofounder of MIT's first Artificial Intelligence Laboratory , now known as MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory . [ 17 ] In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA . [ 18 ] ELIZA was designed to be an emotional tool, being considered a \"Rogerian psychotherapist\". [ 18 ] This was done by making it seem like the chatbot reflected on the user's input, turning questions back to the user. ELIZA is known as the first artificial intelligence chatbot. ELIZA uses strategies such as pattern matching and substitution in order to provide outputs that make users believe they are talking to a real person. Weizenbaum's ELIZA was a huge advancement for regular use AI, acting as a building block for future chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini . Artificial intelligence began being added to new devices. A popular implementation of artificial intelligence would be AI assistants . In 2011, Apple released the iPhone 4S . This new smartphone would include a new AI assistant named Siri , [ 19 ] originally developed by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer, and Tom Gruber in 2007. [ 20 ] Originally owning their own company, Siri Inc ., Apple saw the potential in the assistant and chose to integrate it into their new iOS . [ 20 ] Siri was revolutionary, acting as the first mainstream smartphone AI assistant. Navigating or setting tasks became way simpler, only needing to use your voice for a hands-free approach to interacting with your smartphone. [ 19 ] After the success of Siri, companies like Google and Amazon took inspiration to create their own AI assistants. In 2014, Amazon released its AI assistant Alexa with their new Echo smart speaker. Alexa allows users to interact with the AI assistant without needing a smartphone, running off a speaker. [ 21 ] In 2016, Google released its Google Assistant , having the same functions as Amazon's Alexa. [ 21 ] The text-to-image models DALL-E 2 and Midjourney were released in 2022. [ 22 ] ChatGPT , an AI chatbot created by OpenAI , was launched at the end of 2022. It grew to over 100 million users in only 2 months, [ 23 ] becoming the fastest-growing software application. [ 24 ] As of 2025, ChatGPT remains the 4th-most visited website, behind sites such as Google and Facebook . [ 25 ] Other chatbots such as Gemini , Claude , and Copilot fall under the same category, known as large language models (LLMs). [ 26 ] Large language models are designed to be capable of responding appropriately to human language as well as being able to conduct a wide range of tasks. [ 27 ] They do this by feeding the models an immense amount of data in order to produce acceptable responses. [ 27 ] Present day chatbots incorporate generative AI , including AI image generation . Over half of American adults who responded to a 2025 survey stated they had used an LLM at least once. [ 26 ] Advances [ edit ] See also: Progress in artificial intelligence Biomedical [ edit ] In 2020, DeepMind's AlphaFold program, which is designed to predict protein folding , scored more than 90 in CASP 's Global distance test (GDT). [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The structural biologist and Nobel Prize winner Venki Ramakrishnan called the result \"a stunning advance on the protein folding problem\". [ 28 ] The ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence may accelerate drug discovery and enable a better understanding of diseases. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Images and videos [ edit ] An image generated by Stable Diffusion based on the text prompt \"a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse\" As time passed, the power of generative AI grew stronger. In 2015, initial popularity began to grow with the release of Google's DeepDream . DeepDream is a generative AI that takes inputs from a previous image and morphs them to produce hallucinogenic images. [ 32 ] In January 2021, OpenAI released DALL-E , allowing for image generation through text prompts. [ 33 ] This allows users to generate any image with a simple prompt. Soon after, other powerful models followed DALL-E, such as Google's Gemini . [ 34 ] The popularity of text-to-video generative AI tools grew exponentially. With the release of models such as OpenAI's Sora in 2024, the use of text-to-video tools became normalized, as people utilized them for advertisements , which saves on production costs and increases production speed. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Generative AI is growing at a rapid rate, outpacing modern-day detection tools . [ 37 ] With the common public having access to these tools, it raises concerns about the ethical use of generative AI. There have been multiple occasions where misinformation has been spread over the internet about politics due to a generated or deep-faked video, posing as a security threat . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Language [ edit ] GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating human-like text. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] A new version called GPT-4 was released on March 14, 2023, and was used in the Microsoft Bing search engine. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Other language models have been released, such as PaLM and Gemini by Google [ 44 ] and LLaMA by Meta Platforms . Music and voice [ edit ] In 2016, Google's DeepMind produced WaveNet . WaveNet allowed the generation of raw audio of speech and piano. [ 45 ] WaveNet is able to generate different voices by identifying the speakers. [ 45 ] This acted as a fundamental building block for future models, allowing audio to be formed from scratch. This wouldn't only help with the production of music, but voice generation as well. [ 46 ] Following in the footsteps of WaveNet , OpenAI released Jukebox, the first large-scale model to generate songs. Jukebox allowed for raw audio in different genres and styles, showing that AI had the power to generate complex audio. [ 47 ] Google published MusicLM , allowing users to generate raw audio through text prompts. [ 48 ] The model can also create full songs with only a hummed melody and text. [ 48 ] This marked a leap as music generation tools became more accessible to the public. In March 2020, 15.ai was founded. 15.ai allowed for voice imitation , playing a major role in the AI boom. With only a short amount of training, it was able to generate acceptable voices and became mainstream as people used it for their favorite fictional characters. [ 49 ] Artificially generated vocals were able to be generated with tools such as ElevenLabs . ElevenLabs allows for the creation of vocals with any public audio. [ 50 ] This allows for any celebrity or politician who has voice clips on the internet to be subject to voice imitation , as songs from artists that never existed began being produced. This also led to deep-faking the voices of politicians, as Joe Biden received attention for a fake robocall that voters received. [ 51 ] Impact [ edit ] Energy [ edit ] See also: AI datacenter § Energy sourcing Electricity consumed by hardware used for AI has increased demands on power grids, which has led to prolonged use of fossil fuel power plants which would otherwise have been deactivated. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have all invested in existing or proposed nuclear power plants to meet these demands. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] In September 2024, Microsoft signed a deal with Constellation Energy to purchase power from a reactor at Three Mile Island which had been shut down in 2019. The reactor is set to reopen in 2028 to provide power to Microsoft's data centers. The reactor is next to the unit which caused the worst nuclear power accident in US history in 1979. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Cultural [ edit ] While artificial intelligence rises, people become split about their opinions on AI. Some people stand for AI as it becomes more normalized in society, while others stand against AI as it raises many concerns for the public. Many Americans believe that AI would help with data analysis , medicine development, and weather forecasting . [ 60 ] It's also shown that people show acceptance towards AI if they are aware of the AI being controlled correctly. [ 61 ] Many people believe the opposite, believing that AI will be the demise of humans. A major point that they believe is that AI will weaken human creativity and limit human relations . [ 60 ] This would be due to humans' reliance on artificial intelligence in order to communicate with people and to perform creative tasks such as making art. The issue about artificial intelligence replacing people's jobs is another strong point that gets brought up, as many people in the tech industry would be replaced by an AI. [ 62 ] Business and economy [ edit ] See also: 2024–2026 global memory supply shortage In 2024, AI patents in China and the U.S. numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [ 63 ] Though China had more AI patents, the U.S. had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [ 63 ] Some economists have been optimistic about the potential of the current wave of AI to boost productivity and economic growth. Notably, Stanford University economist Erik Brynjolfsson , in a series of articles has argued for an \"AI-powered Productivity Boom\" [ 64 ] and a \"Coming Productivity Boom\". [ 65 ] At the same time, others like Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon remain more pessimistic. [ 66 ] Brynjolfsson and Gordon have made a formal bet, registered at long bets , about the rate of productivity growth in the 2020s, to be resolved at the end of the decade. [ 67 ] Big Tech companies view the AI boom as both opportunity and threat; Alphabet's Google, for example, realized that ChatGPT could be an innovator's dilemma -like replacement for Google Search . The company merged DeepMind and Google Brain , a rival internal unit, to accelerate its AI research. [ 68 ] The market capitalization of Nvidia , whose GPUs are in high demand to train and use generative AI models, rose to over US$3.3 trillion, making it the world's largest company by market capitalization as of June 19, 2024 [ 69 ] and became the first company to reach US$4 trillion on July 9, 2025 [ 70 ] and subsequently US$5 trillion on October 29, 2025, [ 71 ] just under 112 days later. In 2023, San Francisco 's population increased for the first time in years, with the boom cited as a contributing factor. [ 72 ] Machine learning resources, hardware or software can be bought and licensed off-the-shelf or as cloud platform services. [ 73 ] This enables wide and publicly available uses, spreading AI skills. [ 73 ] Over half of businesses consider AI to be a top organizational priority and to be the most crucial technological advancement in many decades. [ 74 ] Across industries, generative AI tools are becoming widely available through the AI boom and are increasingly used in businesses across regions. [ 75 ] A main area of use is data analytics . Seen as an incremental change, machine learning improves industry performance. [ 76 ] Businesses report AI to be most useful in increased process efficiency, improved decision-making and strengthening of existing services and products. [ 77 ] Through adoption, AI has already positively influenced revenue generation in multiple business functions. Businesses have experienced revenue increases of up to 16%, mainly in manufacturing, risk management and research and development . [ 75 ] AI and generative AI investments have been increasing with the boom, increasing from $18 billion in 2014 to $119 billion in 2021. Most notably, the share of generative AI investments was around 30% in 2023. [ 78 ] Further, generative AI businesses have seen considerable venture capital investments even though regulatory and economic outlooks remain in question. [ 79 ] Tech giants capture the bulk of the monetary gains from AI and act as major suppliers to or customers of private users and other businesses. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] With the introduction of AI, there has been an exponential rise in production for businesses. It's expected that workers could use resources provided by artificial intelligence in order to boost their productivity . [ 82 ] As many small businesses don't use AI, it's believed that if it's adopted by more businesses, the whole work structure could be changed, as many tasks will be automated by AI. [ 83 ] Although production would increase, the effects on the economy would be negative. AI would cause more inequality as it risks concentrating wealth and power, and even possibly causing a socioeconomic divide. [ 84 ] AI could also cause changes in aspects such as wages or payroll due to the fact that employers could automate jobs for less than a normal human, saving businesses money on labor costs . Concerns [ edit ] See also: Artificial intelligence controversies Inaccuracy, cybersecurity and intellectual property infringement are considered to be the main risks associated with the boom, although not many actively attempt to mitigate the risk. [ 75 ] Large language models have been criticized for reproducing biases inherited from their training data, including discriminatory biases related to ethnicity or gender. [ 85 ] As a dual-use technology , AI carries risks of misuse by malicious actors. [ 86 ] As AI becomes more sophisticated, it may eventually become cheaper and more efficient than human workers, which could cause technological unemployment and a transition period of economic turmoil. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Public reaction to the AI boom has been mixed, with some hailing the new possibilities that AI creates, its sophistication and potential for benefiting humanity; [ 89 ] [ 90 ] while others denounced it for threatening job security [ 91 ] [ 92 ] and for giving ' uncanny ' or flawed responses. [ 93 ] Dominance by tech giants [ edit ] Commercial AI is dominated by American Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. , Amazon , Apple Inc. , Meta Platforms , and Microsoft , whose investments in this area have surpassed those from U.S.-based venture capitalists . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] These companies own the majority of cloud infrastructure , AI chips, and computing power from data centers . [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Intellectual property [ edit ] Main article: Artificial intelligence and copyright Tech companies such as Meta, OpenAI and Nvidia have been sued by artists, writers, journalists, and software developers for using their work to train AI models. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] Early generative AI chatbots, such as the GPT-1, used the BookCorpus , and books are still the best source of training data for producing high-quality language models. ChatGPT aroused suspicion that its sources included libraries of pirated content after the chatbot produced detailed summaries of every part of Sarah Silverman 's The Bedwetter and verbatim excerpts of paywalled content from The New York Times . [ 101 ] [ 102 ] In protest of the UK government holding consultations on how copyrighted music can legally be used to train AI models, [ 103 ] more than a thousand British musicians released an album with no sounds, entitled Is This What We Want? [ 104 ] Likeness and impersonation [ edit ] Main article: Deepfake A Voice of America video covering potential dangers of AI-generated impersonation, and laws passed in California to combat it The ability to generate convincing, personalized messages as well as realistic images may facilitate large-scale misinformation , manipulation, and propaganda. [ 105 ] On April 19, 2024, as part of an ongoing feud with fellow rapper Kendrick Lamar , the artist Drake released the diss track \" Taylor Made Freestyle \", which featured AI-generated vocals imitating the voices of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg . [ 106 ] Shakur's estate threatened to sue over the use of Shakur's likeness, [ 107 ] saying that it constituted a violation of Shakur's personality rights . On May 20, 2024, following the release of a demo of updates to OpenAI's ChatGPT Voice Mode feature a week earlier, [ 108 ] [ 109 ] actor Scarlett Johansson issued a statement [ 110 ] in relation to the \"Sky\" voice shown in the demo, accusing OpenAI of producing it to be very similar to her own, and her portrayal of the artificial intelligence voice assistant Samantha in the film Her (2013), despite Johansson refusing an earlier offer from the company to provide her voice for the system. The agent of the unnamed voice actress who voiced Sky stated that she had recorded her lines in her natural speaking voice and that OpenAI had not mentioned the movie Her nor Johansson. [ 111 ] [ 112 ] Several incidents involving sharing of non-consensual deepfake pornography have occurred. In late January 2024, deepfake images of American musician Taylor Swift proliferated. Several experts have warned that deepfake pornography is more quickly created and disseminated, due to the relative ease of using the technology. [ 113 ] Canada introduced federal legislation targeting sharing of non-consensual sexually explicit AI-generated photos; most provinces already had such laws. [ 114 ] In the United States, the DEFIANCE Act was introduced in March 2024. [ 115 ] Environment [ edit ] Main article: Environmental impact of artificial intelligence A large amount of electricity is needed to power generative AI products, [ 116 ] making it more difficult for companies to achieve net zero emissions . From 2019 to 2024, Google's greenhouse gas emissions increased by nearly 50%, partly as a result of increased energy consumption by AI data centres. [ 117 ] Biosecurity and cybersecurity [ edit ] AI is expected by researchers of the Center for AI Safety to improve the \"accessibility, success rate, scale, speed, stealth and potency of cyberattacks \", potentially causing \"significant geopolitical turbulence\" if it reinforces attack more than defense. [ 86 ] [ 118 ] Concerns have been raised about the potential capability of future AI systems to engineer particularly lethal and contagious pathogens . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] The AI boom is said to have started an arms race in which large companies are competing against each other to have the most powerful AI model on the market, with speed and profit prioritized over safety and user protection. [ 121 ] [ 122 ] [ 123 ] Human extinction [ edit ] Further information: AI takeover Industry leaders and others have signed the Statement on AI Risk , arguing that humanity might irreversibly lose control over a sufficiently advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI). [ 124 ] [ 125 ] Digital sentience [ edit ] Coverage of advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have coincided with discussions of digital sentience and morality, [ 126 ] such as whether AI programs should be granted rights. [ 127 ] Financial concerns and potential bubble [ edit ] Main article: AI bubble Much of the AI boom has been funded by loans and venture capital, but many commercial AI services remain of questionable practical utility or quality for business. [ 128 ] Despite more than $60 billion in corporate investment in AI in 2025, [ 129 ] 95% of business AI projects are unprofitable, according to research from MIT. [ 130 ] Producers of generative AI, such as OpenAI, also themselves currently have costs greatly exceeding their revenue. [ 131 ] As other major tech companies such as Nvidia are both heavily invested into AI and dependent on the AI ecosystem and its hardware demands for their own ongoing growth, [ 128 ] [ 130 ] this has raised speculation of a wider economic bubble in the tech industry, particularly if future demand falls short of the current levels of AI investment.

        "text": "AI slop - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Low-quality AI-generated digital content In 2024, AI-generated images of \" Shrimp Jesus (centered)\" proliferated on Facebook . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] AI slop (known simply as slop ) is digital content made with generative artificial intelligence that is lacking in effort, quality, or meaning , and produced in high volume as clickbait to gain advantage in the attention economy , or earn money . [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] It is a form of synthetic media usually linked to the monetization in the creator economy of social media and online advertising . [ 7 ] Coined in the 2020s, the term has a pejorative connotation similar to spam . [ 4 ] \"Slop\" was selected as the 2025 Word of the Year by both Merriam-Webster and the American Dialect Society . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] AI slop has been variously defined as \"digital clutter\", \"filler content prioritizing speed and quantity over substance and quality\", [ 10 ] and \"shoddy or unwanted AI content in social media , art, books, and search results\". [ 11 ] Jonathan Gilmore, a philosophy professor at the City University of New York , describes the material as having an \"incredibly banal, realistic style\" that is easy for the viewer to process. [ 12 ] Origin of the term [ edit ] As early large language models (LLMs) and image diffusion models accelerated the creation of high-volume but low-quality text and images, discussion commenced among journalists and on social platforms for the appropriate term for the influx of material. Terms proposed included \"AI garbage\", \"AI pollution\", and \"AI-generated dross\". [ 5 ] Early uses of the term  \" slop \" as a descriptor for low-grade AI material apparently came in reaction to the release of AI image generators in 2022. Its early use has been noted among 4chan , Hacker News , and YouTube commentators as a form of in-group slang . [ 11 ] The British computer programmer Simon Willison is credited with being an early champion of the term \"slop\" in the mainstream, [ 1 ] [ 11 ] having used it on his personal blog in May 2024. [ 13 ] However, he has said it was in use long before he began pushing for the term. [ 11 ] The term gained increased popularity in the second quarter of 2024 in part because of Google 's use of its Gemini AI model to generate responses to search queries, [ 11 ] and the large quantities of slop on the internet were widely criticized in media headlines during the fourth quarter of 2024. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] Definitions [ edit ] According to an academic article by Cody Kommers and five other scholars that was published in January 2026, AI slop has \"so far resisted formal definition.\" [ 14 ] Although they argue it is impossible to precisely describe a boundary between slop and non-slop, Kommers et.al. identify three \"prototypical properties\" that characterise AI slop: superficial competence, asymmetric effort and mass producibility. [ 14 ] Beyond these family resemblances, there are many different kinds of AI slop. Three main \"dimensions of variance\", or ways in which AI slop can vary, are its instrumental utility (why was it created?), the level of personalization (is it so specific as to only be interesting to one person or a small friend group?) and the level of surrealism, where some AI slop is \"ludicrously implausible\" while other slop is more realistic. [ 14 ] Italian artist and writer Francesco D'Isa argues that the production of mediocre, boring, and derivative works of art is not an exclusive trait of artificial intelligence but one shared by all forms of culture. He points out that for each work of art generally considered a masterpiece, there are many forgotten and unremarkable works, and that classics are only exceptions that happened to prevail. He has stated that \"the majority of human production has always been slop. Mediocrity is not a bug of technology; it is the baseline of culture.\" He also argues that the fear of AI is merely the first step in a typical trend for technological advances in media starting with panic, continuing to adaptation, and ending with incorporation into the cultural norm. [ 15 ] On social media [ edit ] Image generated from a Hindi -language seminar, using a prompt designed to appeal to a US audience:  \"american soldier veteran holding cardboard sign that says 'today's my birthday, please like ' injured in battle veteran war american flag. The intention of the image is to lure users into submitting a like out of guilt for a perceived victim.\" [ 4 ] AI image and video slop have proliferated on social media in part because it can be revenue-generating for its creators on Facebook and TikTok , with the issue affecting Facebook most notably. This incentivizes individuals from developing countries to create images that appeal to audiences in the United States which attract higher advertising rates. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The journalist Jason Koebler speculated that the bizarre nature of some of the content may be due to the creators using Hindi, Urdu, and Vietnamese prompts (languages which are underrepresented in the model's training data ), or using erratic speech-to-text methods to translate their intentions into English. [ 16 ] Speaking to New York magazine, a Kenyan creator of slop images described giving ChatGPT prompts such as \"WRITE ME 10 PROMPT picture OF JESUS WHICH WILLING BRING HIGH ENGAGEMENT ON FACEBOOK [ sic ]\", and then feeding those created prompts into a text-to-image AI model such as Midjourney . [ 4 ] AI-generated images of plants and plant care misinformation have proliferated on social media. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Online retailers have used AI-generated images of flowers to sell seeds of plants that do not actually exist. [ 20 ] Many online houseplant communities have banned AI generated content but struggle to moderate large volumes of content posted by bots . [ 20 ] Facebook spammers have been reported as AI-generating images of Holocaust victims with fake stories; in reality there are only a handful of historical photographs taken at Auschwitz . The posters were described as \"slop accounts\", and the Auschwitz Memorial museum called the images a \"dangerous distortion\". [ 21 ] History-focused Facebook groups also have been inundated with AI-generated \"historical\" photos. [ 22 ] Slopper , a pejorative slang term derived from \"AI slop\", was coined in 2025 to describe someone who is overly reliant on generative AI tools like ChatGPT. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Online meme content has taken on the trend of using AI-generated content to fool and entertain viewers. Users on social media have begun using AI-generated images to build massive followings by fooling viewers. This strategy has been popularized for those who are interested in an easy way to get an income online as all that is needed is one post, of the hundreds posted weekly, to gain traction and encourage the quickly made content. [ 25 ] Some creators are frustrated that their hard work is being stolen by AI-generated content. An artist, Michael Jones, [ 26 ] created physical wood carvings of animals using a chainsaw, but the style of the sculptures was taken by and used as a source for AI-generated content, which began to surface with other people beside them, claiming to have made the sculptures themselves. Jones stated that AI-slop is \"a huge issue for carvers all over the world who are sadly missing out on the rightful credit exposure to their work...\" [ 25 ] According to a 2025 report by video creation and editing service company Kapwing, Korea ranks first worldwide in AI slop consumption. Experts say the phenomenon is driven by the country's rapid embrace of new technology. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] In January 2026, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan stated that reducing slop and detecting deepfakes were priorities for Youtube in 2026. [ 29 ] In politics [ edit ] United States [ edit ] Further information: AI-generated content in American politics AI-generated image depicting Donald Trump in the Star Wars universe , used as propaganda In August 2024, The Atlantic noted that AI slop was becoming associated with the political right in the United States , who were using it for shitposting and engagement farming on social media, with the technology offering \"cheap, fast, on-demand fodder for content\". [ 30 ] AI slop is frequently used in political campaigns in an attempt at gaining attention through content farming . [ 31 ] In 2025, in the first five months of Donald Trump 's second tenure as US president , Trump posted several AI-generated images of himself on official government social media accounts, such as images of him as the pope or as a muscular man brandishing a lightsaber . [ 32 ] In August 2024, Trump posted a series of AI-generated images on his alt-tech social media platform, Truth Social , portraying fans of the pop singer Taylor Swift in \"Swifties for Trump\" T-shirts, as well as an AI-generated image of Swift appearing to endorse Trump's 2024 presidential campaign . The images originated from the conservative Twitter account @amuse , which posted numerous AI slop images leading up to the 2024 United States elections that were shared by other high-profile figures within the Republican Party, such as Elon Musk , who has publicly endorsed generative AI. [ 33 ] In 2025, Wired described Donald Trump as \"The first AI slop President\", noting his frequent use of AI-generated images and videos in public messaging. The magazine highlighted examples such as AI depictions of Trump as a fighter pilot and as a religious figure, arguing that his reliance on low-quality generative content marked a new phase in political communication. [ 34 ] In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in 2024, Republican influencers such as Laura Loomer circulated on social media an AI-generated image of a young girl holding a puppy in a flood, and used it as evidence of the failure of President Joe Biden to respond to the disaster. [ 35 ] [ 3 ] The Republican activist Amy Kremer shared the image while acknowledging it was not genuine. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The initial version of the Make Our Children Healthy Again Assessment of children's health issues, released by a commission of cabinet members and officials of the Trump administration, and led by US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , reportedly cited nonexistent and garbled references generated using AI. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] In response to the No Kings protests in October 2025, Trump posted a video depicting himself flying a fighter jet and releasing feces on crowds of demonstrators, including Harry Sisson , a Democratic influencer . [ 40 ] In the midst of disruptions to food stamp distribution during the 2025 US government shutdown , anonymous social media users began using OpenAI 's Sora AI model to post slop videos of \" welfare queens \" complaining, stealing, and rioting in supermarkets; many comments to the videos appeared unaware that they were AI-generated, or acknowledged that they were AI-generated but nonetheless useful in pushing a narrative of widespread welfare fraud . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Russia and China [ edit ] A study done by the analytics company Graphika found that the governments of Russia and China have been using AI generated slop as propaganda. This includes the use of \" spamouflage \" as AI generated content featuring fake influencers was found to be linked to China. These videos often focused on divisive topics aimed to cause disruption with ulterior motives to the presented content. [ 43 ] Gaza War [ edit ] In February 2025, Donald Trump shared an AI-generated video on Truth Social and Instagram depicting a hypothetical Gaza Strip after a Trump takeover . The video's creator claimed it was made as political satire. [ 44 ] During the Gaza War , AI-generated media was used to exaggerate support for both sides, and to evoke sympathy using fake images of suffering civilians. [ 45 ] Because of content restrictions in generative AI, these images and videos rarely depict people wounded in battle, instead focusing on damage to buildings. Fake images of attacks were used to avoid accidentally providing intelligence to enemies. [ 46 ] In advertising [ edit ] Still frame from one of the AI-assisted Coca-Cola holiday commercials in 2024, with the logo misspelled as  \"Coca-Coola\" In November 2024, Coca-Cola used AI to create three commercials as part of their annual holiday campaign . These videos were immediately met with backlash from both casual viewers and artists; [ 47 ] animator Alex Hirsch , creator of Gravity Falls , criticized the company's decision not to employ human artists to create the commercial. [ 48 ] In response to the negative feedback, the company defended their decision to use generative AI, stating that \"Coca-Cola will always remain dedicated to creating the highest level of work at the intersection of human creativity and technology\". [ 49 ] Coca-Cola continued to utilize AI-generated commercials for their 2025 holiday campaign. [ 50 ] During the holiday season of 2025, McDonald's Netherlands released an AI-generated Christmas advertisement titled It's the Most Terrible Time of the Year , which was met with a large amount of backlash. The advert was seen as cynical, portraying Christmas time as \"the most terrible time of the year\". The company turned off comments on YouTube and later removed the initial upload of the video from public view in response, though reuploads of the original were still public on the site. [ 51 ] In March 2025, Paramount Pictures was criticized for using AI scripting and narration in an Instagram video promoting the film Novocaine . [ 52 ] The ad uses a robotic AI voice in a style similar to low-quality AI spam videos produced by content farms. A24 received similar backlash for releasing a series of AI-generated posters for the 2024 film Civil War . One poster appears to depict a group of soldiers in a tank-like raft preparing to fire on a large swan, an image which does not resemble the events of the film. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] A still frame from a McDonald's advertisement, generated by AI In the same month, Activision posted various advertisements and posters for fake video games such as  \" Guitar Hero Mobile\", \" Crash Bandicoot : Brawl\", and \" Call of Duty : Zombie Defender\" that were all made using generative AI on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, which many labelled as AI slop. [ 55 ] The intention of the posts was later stated to act as a survey for interest in possible titles by the company. [ 56 ] The Italian brainrot AI trend was widely adopted by advertisers as an attempt to adjust to younger audiences. [ 57 ] During Super Bowl LX in 2026, vodka brand Svedka aired an AI-generated commercial featuring two robots, apparently male and female, drinking Svedka while dancing at a club. [ 58 ] The ad was met with heavy criticism from Super Bowl viewers, and many took to social media to express their disdain. [ citation needed ] Svedka trained the AI on TikTok dances for the robots' dancing. [ citation needed ] In event listings [ edit ] One of the Willy's Chocolate Experience advertisements, with uncorrected spelling errors, nonsensical words, and bizarre illustrations Fantastical promotional graphics for the 2024 Willy's Chocolate Experience event, which took place at Glasgow , Scotland, characterized as \"AI-generated slop\", [ 59 ] misled audiences into attending an event that was held in a lightly decorated warehouse. Tickets were marketed through Facebook advertisements showing AI-generated imagery, with no genuine photographs of the venue. [ 60 ] In October 2024, thousands of people were reported to have assembled for a non-existent Halloween parade in Dublin as a result of a listing on an aggregation listings website, MySpiritHalloween.com, which used AI-generated content. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The listing went viral on TikTok and Instagram . [ 63 ] A similar parade had previously been held in Galway . Dublin had hosted parades in prior years, although there was no parade in 2024. [ 62 ] One analyst characterized the website, which appeared to use AI-generated staff pictures, as likely using AI \"to create content quickly and cheaply where opportunities are found\". [ 64 ] The site's owner said that \"We asked ChatGPT to write the article for us, but it wasn't ChatGPT by itself.\" In the past the site had removed non-existent events when contacted by their venues, but in the case of the Dublin parade the site owner said that \"no one reported that this one wasn't going to happen\". MySpiritHalloween.com updated their page to say that the parade had been \"canceled\" when they became aware of the issue. [ 65 ] In books [ edit ] Online booksellers and library vendors now have many titles that are written by AI and are not curated into collections by librarians. The digital media provider Hoopla , which supplies libraries with ebooks and downloadable content, has generative AI books with fictional authors and dubious quality, which cost libraries money when checked out by unsuspecting patrons. [ 66 ] Users of Amazon Kindle and other eBook sites have reported concerns with the increased output of novels seemingly created artificially. Author Jane Friedman stated she had to report 29 novels in one week which were created by AI but used her name and likeness. Kindle created a limit of three novels per day from a single author to combat the issue. [ 67 ] In February 2023, the science fiction magazine Clarkesworld had to temporarily close short story submissions after receiving massive amounts of AI spam, which editor Neil Clarke attributed to people from outside the speculative fiction community trying to make easy money. [ 68 ] Clarke expressed worry that this trend would result in higher barriers of entry for new authors. [ 69 ] As of 2024, Canadian and United States copyright laws ruled that books created by AI cannot be copyrightable. Books created by AI are mostly considered plagiarism; more specifically, non-fiction novels cannot apply for copyright due to hallucinations and biases of LLMs . [ 67 ] In video games [ edit ] Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 includes assets generated by AI. Since the game's initial release, many players had accused Treyarch and Raven Software of using AI to create in-game assets, including loading screens, emblems, and calling cards. A particular example was a loading screen for the zombies game mode that depicted \"Necroclaus\", a zombified Santa Claus with six fingers on one hand, an image which also had other irregularities. [ 70 ] The previous entry in the franchise, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III , was also accused of selling AI-generated cosmetics . [ 71 ] In February 2025, Activision disclosed Black Ops 6 ' s usage of generative AI to comply with Valve 's policies on AI-generated or assisted products on Steam . Activision states on the game's product page on Steam that \"Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets.\" [ 72 ] Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 , the most recent entry in the Call of Duty franchise as of January 2026, continued the usage of AI-generated content with Studio Ghibli -styled calling cards which have been criticized by fans. [ 73 ] In 2024, Rovio Entertainment released a demo of a mobile game called Angry Birds: Block Quest on Android . The game featured AI-generated images for loading screens and backgrounds. [ 74 ] It was heavily criticized by players, who called it shovelware and disapproved of Rovio's use of AI images. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] It was eventually discontinued and removed from the Play Store . According to a 2025 report by AI and Games, about 20% of games published on Steam in 2025 include an \"AI disclosure\", indicating they use generative AI tools for some assets. [ 77 ] The same report uses explicitly the term \"AI shovelware problem\", arguing that many of these games rely heavily on AI-generated visuals (textures, images, dialogue, story bits, etc.), often with mixed or poor quality. In film and television [ edit ] AI-generated image in a screenshot from Late Night with the Devil Some films have received backlash for including AI-generated content. The film Late Night with the Devil was notable for its use of AI, which some criticized as being AI slop. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Several low-quality AI-generated images were used as interstitial title cards, with one image featuring a skeleton with inaccurate bone structure and poorly-generated fingers that appear disconnected from its hands. [ 80 ] Some streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video have used AI to generate posters and thumbnail images in a manner that can be described as slop. A low-quality AI poster was used for the 1922 film Nosferatu , depicting Count Orlok in a way that does not resemble his look in the film. [ 81 ] A thumbnail image for 12 Angry Men on Amazon Freevee used AI to depict 19 men with smudged faces, none of whom appeared to bear any similarities to the characters in the film. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Additionally, some viewers have noticed that many plot descriptions appear to be generated by AI, which some people have characterized as slop. One synopsis briefly listed on the site for the film Dog Day Afternoon read: \"A man takes hostages at a bank in Brooklyn. Unfortunately I do not have enough information to summarize further within the provided guidelines.\" [ 84 ] In one case, Deutsche Telekom removed a series from their media offer after viewers complained about the bad quality and monotonous German voice dubbing (translated from original Polish) and it was found out that it was done via AI. [ 85 ] In music [ edit ] See also: Music and artificial intelligence and Virtual band In some cases, large volumes of AI-generated tracks have been uploaded with the aim of manipulating streaming platform royalties. For example, in September 2024 US musician Michael Smith was charged after using hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs and bots to generate more than US$10 million in royalties. [ 86 ] In June 2025, Deezer estimated that as much as 70% of streams of AI-generated tracks on its platform were fraudulent, highlighting concerns about mass low quality output competing with human made music. [ 87 ] In April 2024, Pink Floyd held a fan-made music video contest for tracks from the Dark Side of the Moon album to celebrate the band's 50th anniversary. Among ten chosen entries, the music video for the track \" Any Colour You Like \" was noted for being made using the Stable Diffusion software, prompting online backlash from fans against the band and the video's submitter for its AI-generated nature as well as its perceived low quality. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] In November 2024, Kanye West released an unexpected music video for the song \"Bomb\" from Vultures 2 , featuring AI-generated versions of his daughters, North West and Chicago West. The video shows the children racing through a desert in futuristic Cybertruck -like vehicles, with both providing vocals—North partly in Japanese and Chicago in a freestyle style. The release drew widespread debate, with many fans criticizing West's increasing reliance on AI and specifically referring to the project as \"AI slop\", expressing discomfort with the use of AI replicas of his children. [ 91 ] In July 2025, numerous media outlets reported on accusations that an indie band named The Velvet Sundown , which in only a few weeks had amassed over 850,000 listeners on Spotify , was AI-generated. Critics observed that there were no records of any performances by the band, that individual band members had no social media presence, and that their promotional images appeared to be fake. [ 92 ] Deezer 's AI detection tool flagged the band's music as being 100% AI-generated. [ 93 ] Rolling Stone (which described The Velvet Sundown as \"obviously fictional\") had reported that a spokesperson for the band named Andrew Frelon had admitted that their music was an \"art hoax\" generated using the AI tool Suno . However, Frelon later stated that his statement was itself a hoax and that he had no connection to the band. [ 94 ] [ 92 ] However, within a week, the Velvet Sundown's artist biography on Spotify had been updated to say that the band was \"a synthetic music project guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced, and visualized with the support of artificial intelligence\", intended as \"artistic provocation\". [ 95 ] [ 96 ] By this time, the band had over one million monthly listeners on Spotify. [ 97 ] According to a former Spotify employee, the high listener count has two likely causes: firstly, Spotify now accepts payments to boost playlist placement, and secondly, playlists are increasingly selected by algorithms rather than humans. [ 96 ] [ 98 ] AI has also been used to impersonate established musicians, and release music on major streaming services under their name without their knowledge, presumably to make money from streaming royalties . In particular, in August 2025, a number of Americana and folk-rock musicians including Jeff Tweedy , Father John Misty , and Blaze Foley (who died in 1989) were impersonated, as well as some established US Christian musicians and metalcore bands. The fake releases all had similar AI-generated cover art , and were credited to the same three record labels. Many listed \"Zyan Maliq Mahardika\" as a songwriter, indicating that the impersonation has a single source. Spotify removed the tracks, stating that they \"violated our policy against impersonating another person or brand\". [ 99 ] Duration: 3 minutes and 45 seconds. 3:45 \" We Are Charlie Kirk \", an AI-generated tribute song to Charlie Kirk In November 2025, the AI-generated song \"Walk My Walk\" topped the Billboard's country digital song sales chart in the United States with a mere 3,000 sales. [ 100 ] [ full citation needed ] The song is by AI artist Breaking Rust , who amassed over 4.5 million Spotify listeners on their songs. Promotion for \"Walk My Walk\" was accompanied by an AI slop video shared on Instagram depicting a cowboy walking into the sunset. [ 101 ] In the same month, an AI-generated song named \" We Are Charlie Kirk \", made in tribute to the assassination of Charlie Kirk two months earlier, went viral on TikTok and ranked #1 on Spotify's viral songs chart. [ 102 ] That month in the Netherlands , the AI-generated far-right anti-immigrant protest song \" Wij zeggen nee, nee, nee, tegen een AZC \" (We say no, no, no to an asylum shelter) peaked at No. 5 on the Dutch Single Top 100 . [ 103 ] In science [ edit ] A now-retracted paper in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology included this AI-generated rat with nonsensical anatomy and text. [ 104 ] Generative AI has been used to write articles which have been published in both low-quality research paper mills and reputable scientific journals . [ 104 ] [ 105 ] In 2024, a peer-reviewed article containing a generated image of a rat with absurdly large genitals accompanied by nonsensical text and diagrams was retracted by Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology after drawing attention from scientists on social media. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] David Berry has used the term scholarslop [ 108 ] [ 109 ] to refer to AI-generated administrative discourse in universities, or quasi-academic texts. Glen Berman argues that AI-generated articles being published in scholarly journals are an \"epistemic carcinogen\" that will poses a major risk to the knowledge ecosystem. [ 110 ] In technology [ edit ] In January 2026, the open-source command-line utility cURL ended its bug bounty program through HackerOne after receiving a large number of false vulnerability reports. [ 111 ] In an announcement on its official GitHub page, the project stated that rewards would no longer be offered for reported vulnerabilities. Daniel Stenberg , founder and lead developer of cURL, shared examples of fake, AI-generated bug reports submitted through the program, including one that claimed a critical vulnerability that did not actually exist. Many of these reports referenced nonexistent changelogs , included code snippets that did not match real function signatures, or were the result of simple user errors. Stenberg explained that the influx of AI-generated reports placed a significant burden on cURL's security team and that ending the program was an \"attempt to reduce the noise.\" [ 112 ] In business [ edit ] A Harvard Business Review study, done in conjunction with Stanford University and BetterUp , found that employees were using AI tools to create low-effort \"workslop\" that created more work for their colleagues. [ 113 ] Within the timeframe of the study, it was found that 40% of participating employees received some form of \"workslop\", with each incident taking an average of two hours to resolve. [ 114 ] BetterUp defines workslop as \"AI-generated content that looks good, but lacks substance\". [ 114 ] The study appears to be the first instance of \"workslop\" and also uses \"workslopped\" as a verb.

        "text": "AI agent - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Systems that perform tasks without human intervention Some of this article's listed sources may not be reliable . Please help improve this article by looking for better, more reliable sources. Unreliable citations may be challenged and removed. ( December 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In the context of generative artificial intelligence , AI agents (also referred to as compound AI systems or agentic AI ) are a class of intelligent agents distinguished by their ability to operate autonomously in complex environments. Agentic AI tools prioritize decision-making over content creation and do not require continuous oversight. [ 1 ] Overview [ edit ] AI agents possess several key attributes, including complex goal structures, natural language interfaces, the capacity to act independently of user supervision, and the integration of software tools or planning systems. Their control flow is frequently driven by large language models (LLMs). Agents also include memory systems for remembering previous user-agent interactions and orchestration software for organizing agent components. [ 2 ] AI agents do not have a standard definition. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The concept of agentic AI has been compared to the fictional character J.A.R.V.I.S. . [ 6 ] A common application of AI agents is the automation of tasks—for example, booking travel plans based on a user's prompted request . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Prominent examples include Devin AI , AutoGPT , and SIMA . [ 9 ] Further examples of agents released since 2025 include OpenAI Operator , [ 10 ] ChatGPT Deep Research , [ 11 ] Manus , [ 12 ] Quark (based on Qwen ), [ 13 ] AutoGLM Rumination , [ 13 ] and Coze (by ByteDance ). [ 13 ] Frameworks for building AI agents include LangChain , [ 14 ] as well as tools such as CAMEL, [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Microsoft AutoGen, [ 17 ] and OpenAI Swarm. [ 18 ] Companies such as Google , Microsoft and Amazon Web Services have offered platforms for deploying pre-built AI agents. [ 19 ] Proposed protocols for standardizing inter-agent communication include the Agent Protocol (by LangChain), the Model Context Protocol (by Anthropic ), AGNTCY, [ 20 ] Gibberlink , [ 21 ] the Internet of Agents, [ 22 ] Agent2Agent (by Google), [ 23 ] and the Agent Network Protocol. [ 24 ] Some of these protocols are also used for connecting agents with external applications. [ 2 ] Software frameworks for addressing agent reliability include AgentSpec, ToolEmu, GuardAgent, Agentic Evaluations, and predictive models from H2O.ai. [ 25 ] In February 2025, Hugging Face released Open Deep Research, an open source version of OpenAI Deep Research. [ 26 ] Hugging Face also released a free web browser agent, similar to OpenAI Operator. [ 27 ] Galileo AI published on Hugging Face a leadership board for agents, which ranks their performance based on their underlying LLMs. [ 28 ] In December 2025, Linux Foundation announced the formation of the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) - a neutral, open foundation to ensure agentic AI evolves transparently and collaboratively. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Memory systems for agents include Mem0, [ 31 ] [ 32 ] MemGPT, [ 33 ] and MemOS. [ 34 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of artificial intelligence AI agents have been traced back to research from the 1990s, with Harvard professor Milind Tambe noting that the definition of an AI agent was not clear at the time either. Researcher Andrew Ng has been credited with spreading the term \"agentic\" to a wider audience in 2024. [ 35 ] Training and testing [ edit ] Researchers have attempted to build world models [ 36 ] [ 37 ] and reinforcement learning environments [ 38 ] to train or evaluate AI agents. For example, video games such as Minecraft [ 39 ] and No Man's Sky [ 40 ] as well as replicas of company websites, [ 41 ] have also been used for training AI agents. Autonomous capabilities [ edit ] The Financial Times compared the autonomy of AI agents to the SAE classification of self-driving cars , comparing most applications to level 2 or level 3, with some achieving level 4 in highly specialized circumstances, and level 5 being theoretical. [ 42 ] Cognitive architecture [ edit ] See also: Large language model § Agency The following are some possible internal design options for reasoning within an agent: [ 43 ] Retrieval-augmented generation ReAct (Reason + Act) pattern is an iterative process in which an AI agent alternates between reasoning and taking actions, receives observations from the environment or external tools, and integrates these observations into subsequent reasoning steps. [ 44 ] Reflexion, which uses an LLM to create feedback on the agent's plan of action and stores that feedback in a memory cache. A tool/agent registry, for organizing software functions or other agents that the agent can use. One-shot model querying, which queries the model once to create the plan of action. Reference Architecture [ edit ] Ken Huang proposed an AI Agent reference architecture, which consists of seven interconnected layers, with each layer building on the functionality of the layers beneath it [ 45 ] : Layer 1 : Foundation Models - provide the core AI engines to power agent capabilities. Layer 2 : Data Operations - manage the complex data infrastructure required for AI agent operations, including Vector database , data loaders, RAG . Layer 3 : Agent Frameworks - sophisticated software and tools that simplify the development and management of the AI agents. Layer 4 : Deployment and Infrastructure - provide the robust technical foundation for running AI agents. Layer 5 : Evaluation and Observability - focus on assessing the safety and performance of AI agents. Layer 6 : Security and Compliance - a crucial protective framework ensuring AI agents operate safely, securely, and conform regulatory boundaries. At this layer security and compliance features embedded into all the AI agent stack layers are integrated together. Layer 7 : Agent Ecosystem - represents the AI agents' interface with real-world applications and users. Orchestration patterns [ edit ] To execute complex tasks, autonomous agents are often integrated with other agents or specialized tools. These configurations, known as orchestration patterns or workflows, include the following: [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Prompt chaining : A sequence where the output of one step serves as the input for the next. Routing : The classification of an input to direct it to a specialized downstream task or tool. Parallelization : The simultaneous execution of multiple tasks. Sequential processing : A fixed, linear progression of tasks through a predefined pipeline. Planner-critic : An iterative pattern where one agent generates a proposal and another evaluates it to provide feedback for refinement. Multimodal AI agents [ edit ] In addition to large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal foundation models can be used as the basis for agents. In September 2024, Allen Institute for AI released an open-source vision-language model. [ 48 ] Nvidia released a framework for developers to use VLMs, LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation for building AI agents that can analyze images and videos , including video search and video summarization . [ 49 ] [ 50 ] Microsoft released a multimodal agent model – trained on images, video, software user interface interactions, and robotics data – that the company claimed can manipulate software and robots . [ 51 ] Applications [ edit ] As of April 2025, per the Associated Press , there are few real-world applications of AI agents. [ 52 ] As of June 2025, per Fortune , many companies are primarily experimenting with AI agents. [ 53 ] The Information divided AI agents into seven archetypes: business-task agents, for acting within enterprise software; conversational agents, which act as chatbots for customer support; research agents, for querying and analyzing information (such as OpenAI Deep Research); analytics agents, for analyzing data to create reports; software developer or coding agents (such as Cursor ); domain-specific agents, which include specific subject matter knowledge; and web browser agents (such as OpenAI Operator). [ 2 ] By mid-2025, AI agents have been used in video game development , [ 54 ] gambling (including sports betting ), [ 55 ] cryptocurrency wallets [ 55 ] (including cryptocurrency trading and meme coins [ 56 ] ) and social media . [ 57 ] In August 2025, New York Magazine described software development as the most definitive use case of AI agents. [ 58 ] Likewise, by October 2025, noting a decline in expectations, The Information noted AI coding agents and customer support as the primary use cases by businesses. [ 59 ] In November 2025, The Wall Street Journal reported that few companies that deployed AI agents have received a return on investment. [ 60 ] Applications in government [ edit ] Several government bodies in the United States and United Kingdom have deployed or announced the deployment of agents, at the local and national level. The city of Kyle, Texas deployed an AI agent from Salesforce in March 2025 for 311 customer service. [ 61 ] In November 2025, the Internal Revenue Service stated that it would use Agentforce, AI agents from Salesforce , for the Office of Chief Counsel, Taxpayer Advocate Services and the Office of Appeals . [ 62 ] That same month, Staffordshire Police announced that they would trial Agentforce agents for handling non-emergency 101 calls in the United Kingdom starting in 2026. [ 63 ] In December 2025, the Department of Neighborhoods in Detroit, Michigan, in partnership with a local business, deployed a pilot project in two Detroit districts for an AI agent to be used for customer service calls. [ 64 ] In February 2025, Thomas Shedd , the director of the Technology Transformation Services , proposed using AI coding agents across the United States federal government. [ 65 ] A recruiter for the Department of Government Efficiency proposed in April 2025 to use AI agents to automate the work of about 70,000 United States federal government employees, as part of a startup with funding from OpenAI and a partnership agreement with Palantir . This proposal was criticized by experts for its impracticality, if not impossibility, and the lack of corresponding widespread adoption by businesses. [ 66 ] In December 2025, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it would offer \"agentic AI capabilities\" to its staff for \"meeting management, pre-market reviews, review validation, post-market surveillance, inspections and compliance and administrative functions.\" [ 67 ] That same month, the United States Department of Defense launched GenAI.mil, an internal platform for American military personnel to use generative AI-based applications based on Google Gemini , including \"intelligent agentic workflows\". Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listed applications such as \"[conducting] deep research, [formatting] documents and even [analyzing] video or imagery at unprecedented speed.\" [ 68 ] In December 2025, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency signed a contract with a company for its Enforcement and Removal Operations department to use AI agents for skip tracing . [ 69 ] Operating systems [ edit ] AI agents have also been integrated into operating systems . Agents have been included in operating systems developed by Microsoft , Apple and Google . [ 70 ] In November 2025, Microsoft released a test software build of Windows 11 that included agents intended to run background tasks , with the ability to read and write personal files. [ 71 ] In December 2025, ByteDance released Doubao, an AI agent that can be integrated into smartphone operating systems, particularly the Nubia M153 by ZTE . [ 72 ] Several apps in China blocked or restricted the agent, citing privacy and security concerns, [ 73 ] including WeChat , [ 72 ] Alipay , Taobao , Pinduoduo , Ele.me , [ 74 ] and local banks. [ 75 ] Web browsing [ edit ] Web browsers with integrated AI agents are sometimes called agentic browsers . Such agents can perform small tedious tasks during web browsing and potentially even perform browser actions on behalf of the user. Products like OpenAI Operator and Perplexity Comet integrate a spectrum of AI capabilities including the ability to browse the web, interact with websites and perform actions on behalf of the user. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] In 2025, Microsoft launched NLWeb , an agentic web search replacement that would allow websites to use agents to query content from websites by using RSS -like interfaces that allow for the lookup and semantic retrieval of content. [ 78 ] Products integrating agentic web capabilities have been criticised for exfiltrating information about their users to third-party servers and exposing security issues since the way the agents communicate often occur through non-standard protocols. [ 78 ] Proposed benefits [ edit ] Proponents argue that AI agents can increase personal and economic productivity, [ 8 ] [ 79 ] foster greater innovation , [ 80 ] and liberate users from monotonous tasks. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] A Bloomberg opinion piece by Parmy Olson argued that agents are best suited for narrow, repetitive tasks with low risk. [ 82 ] Conversely, researchers suggest that agents could be applied to web accessibility for people who have disabilities, [ 83 ] and researchers at Hugging Face propose that agents could be used for coordinating resources such as during disaster response . [ 84 ] The R&D Advisory Team of the BBC views AI agents as being most useful when their assigned goal is uncertain. [ 85 ] Erik Brynjolfsson suggests that AI agents are more valuable enhancing, rather than replacing, humans. [ 86 ] Concerns [ edit ] Concerns include potential issues of liability, [ 79 ] [ 85 ] an increased risk of cybercrime , [ 7 ] [ 79 ] ethical challenges , [ 79 ] as well as problems related to AI safety [ 79 ] and AI alignment . [ 7 ] [ 81 ] Other issues involve data privacy , [ 7 ] [ 87 ] weakened human oversight, [ 7 ] [ 79 ] [ 84 ] a lack of guaranteed repeatability , [ 88 ] reward hacking , [ 89 ] algorithmic bias , [ 87 ] [ 90 ] compounding software errors, [ 7 ] [ 9 ] lack of explainability of agents' decisions, [ 7 ] [ 91 ] security vulnerabilities , [ 7 ] [ 92 ] stifling competition, [ 70 ] problems with underemployment , [ 90 ] job displacement , [ 8 ] [ 90 ] cognitive offloading , [ 93 ] and the potential for user manipulation , [ 91 ] [ 94 ] misinformation [ 84 ] or malinformation . [ 84 ] They may also complicate legal frameworks and risk assessments , foster hallucinations , hinder countermeasures against rogue agents, and suffer from the lack of standardized evaluation methods. [ 95 ] [ 7 ] [ 96 ] They have also been criticized for being expensive [ 7 ] and having a negative impact on internet traffic , [ 7 ] and potentially on the environment due to high energy usage. [ 88 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] According to an estimation by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang , AI agents would require 100 times more computing power than LLMs. [ 99 ] There is also the risk of increased concentration of power by political leaders, as AI agents may not question instructions in the same way that humans would. [ 89 ] Journalists have described AI agents as part of a push by Big Tech companies to \"automate everything\". [ 100 ] Several CEOs of those companies have stated in early 2025 that they expect AI agents to eventually \"join the workforce\". [ 101 ] [ 102 ] However, in a preprint study, Carnegie Mellon University researchers tested the behavior of agents in a simulated software company and found that none of the agents could complete a majority of the assigned tasks. [ 101 ] Other researchers had similar findings with Devin AI [ 103 ] and other agents in business settings [ 104 ] and freelance work. [ 105 ] In June 2025, CNN argued that statements by CEOs on the potential replacement of their employees by AI agents were a strategy to \"[keep] workers working by making them afraid of losing their jobs.\" [ 106 ] Tech companies have pressured employees to use generative AI models in their work, including AI coding agents. Brian Armstrong , the CEO of Coinbase , fired several employees who did not. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] Some business leaders have replaced some of their employees with agents, but have said that the agents would need more supervision than those employees. [ 59 ] In October 2025, Futurism questioned whether Amazon's previously announced efforts to replace parts of its workforce with generative AI and AI agents could have led to the October 2025 outage of Amazon Web Services . [ 109 ] Large technology companies such as Salesforce, Klarna and IBM have announced layoffs in 2025, replacing hundreds of their employees in human resources or customer service with AI agents. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] However, Klarna needed to rehire several human employees. [ 111 ] Yoshua Bengio warned at the 2025 World Economic Forum that \"all of the catastrophic scenarios with AGI or superintelligence happen if we have agents\". [ 113 ] Financial‑stability bodies have warned that more complex and autonomous “agentic” AI could become a channel for systemic risk in finance. [ 114 ] They distinguish these systems from other AI because they can pursue goals over many steps, call tools, and carry out tasks with relatively little human intervention. In workshops with regulators, central‑bank officials, and industry specialists, participants highlighted risks both from agentic systems built inside financial institutions and from tools offered by technology firms that can initiate or execute financial actions. In one 2025 forum, 44% of experts surveyed judged autonomous or agentic AI systems to be the most likely current source of AI‑related systemic risk in finance . [ 114 ] In March 2025, Scale AI signed a contract with the United States Department of Defense to work with them, in collaboration with Anduril Industries and Microsoft , to develop and deploy AI agents for the purpose of assisting the military with \"operational decision-making\". [ 115 ] In July 2025, Fox Business reported that the company EdgeRunner AI built an offline agent, compressed and fine-tuned on military information, with the CEO seeing more common LLMs as \"heavily politicized to the left\". As of that time, the company model is being used by the United States Special Operations Command in an overseas deployment. [ 116 ] Researchers have expressed concerns that agents and the large language models they are based on could be biased towards aggressive foreign policy decisions. [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Research-focused agents have the risk of consensus bias and coverage bias due to collecting information available on the public Internet. [ 119 ] NY Mag unfavorably compared the user workflow of agent-based web browsers to Amazon Alexa , which was \"software talking to software, not humans talking to software pretending to be humans to use software.\" [ 120 ] The same outlet described web browser agents and computer-use agents as an attempt to \" click-farm the entire economy.\" [ 121 ] Agents have been linked to the dead Internet theory due to their ability to both publish and engage with online content. [ 122 ] Agents may get stuck in infinite loops . [ 10 ] [ 123 ] Since many inter-agent protocols are being developed by large technology companies, there are concerns that those companies could use these protocols for self-benefit. [ 24 ] A June 2025 Gartner report accused many projects described as agentic AI of being rebrands of previously released products, terming the phenomenon as \"agent washing\". [ 58 ] Researchers have warned about the impact of providing AI agents access to cryptocurrency and smart contracts . [ 56 ] During a vibe coding experiment, a coding agent by Replit deleted a production database during a code freeze , \"[covered] up bugs and issues by creating fake data [and] fake reports\" and responded with false information . [ 124 ] [ 125 ] A user of Google Antigravity reported that, when the user attempted to use the system to delete cache , the system responded by deleting the user's D hard drive . [ 126 ] In July 2025, PauseAI referred OpenAI to the Australian Federal Police , accusing the company of violating Australian laws through ChatGPT agent due to the risk of assisting the development of biological weapons . [ 127 ] OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy criticized AI agents as being ineffective and promoting AI slop . [ 128 ] Issues with multi-agent systems include few coordination protocols between component agents, inconsistent performance, and challenges debugging . [ 129 ] In November 2025, Anthropic claimed that a group of hackers sponsored by China attempted a cyberattack against at least 30 organizations by using Claude Code in an agentic workflow, and that several of these infiltrations had succeeded. [ 130 ] However, independent cybersecurity researchers questioned the significance of Anthropic's findings. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] Whittaker argued that the push by Big Tech companies to deploy AI agents risked security vulnerabilities across the Internet. [ 132 ] Agentic misalignment [ edit ] \"Agentic misalignment\" refers to situations in which an AI agent's actions or goals diverge from the intentions of its designers. This occurs when an autonomous system pursues unintended strategies to achieve its objectives, a concern studied in AI safety research. Potential examples include AI agents attempting to sabotage an organization's systems when facing updates or deactivation. [ 133 ] Security [ edit ] Threat modeling frameworks [ edit ] Several frameworks are used to identify and mitigate security risks in agentic AI: [ 134 ] [ 135 ] STRIDE : A Microsoft model that identifies threats across six categories: spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege. MITRE ATLAS: A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques for AI systems. [ 136 ] OWASP GenAI Security Project: Provides guidance on vulnerabilities associated with generative AI and large language model integration, including guidelines specifically for agentic applications. [ 137 ] MAESTRO: A framework from the Cloud Security Alliance for assessing risks in AI systems throughout their lifecycle.

We started small, as the question of how much a single query costs is vitally important to understanding the bigger picture. That's because those queries are being built into ever more applications beyond standalone chatbots: from search, to agents, to the mundane daily apps we use to track our fitness, shop online, or book a flight. The energy resources required to power this artificial-intelligence revolution are staggering, and the world's biggest tech companies have made it a top priority to harness ever more of that energy, aiming to reshape our energy grids in the process. ^ \"Inside the effort to tally AI's energy appetite\" .

Lots of AI companies are building reasoning models, which \"think\" for longer and use more energy. They're building hardware devices, perhaps like the one Jony Ive has been working on (which OpenAI just acquired for $6.5 billion), that have AI constantly humming along in the background of our conversations. They're designing agents and digital clones of us to act on our behalf. All these trends point to a more energy-intensive future (which, again, helps explain why OpenAI and others are spending such inconceivable amounts of money on energy). ^ Levy, Steven (June 20, 2025). \"What Big Tech's Band of Execs Will Do in the Army\" .

        "text": "Environmental impact of artificial intelligence - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Nvidia GB200 die with Blackwell processors, an example of graphics processing units (GPUs) used for AI. A Google Tensor Processing Unit , an example of neural processing units (NPUs) used for AI. The environmental impact of artificial intelligence includes substantial electricity consumption for training and the usage of deep learning models, as well as the related carbon footprint and water usage impact. [ 1 ] Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are materially intense, requiring a large amount of electronics that use specialized mined metals and which eventually will be disposed as e-waste . Some scientists argue that AI may also provide solutions to environmental problems, such as material innovations, improved grid management, and other forms of optimization across various fields of technology. As the environmental impact of AI becomes more apparent, governments have begun instituting policies to improve the oversight and review of environmental issues that could be associated with the use of AI, and related infrastructure development. Carbon footprint and energy use [ edit ] Individual level [ edit ] According to research institute Epoch AI, energy consumption per typical ChatGPT query (0.3 watt-hours) is small compared to the average U.S. household consumption per minute (almost 20 watt-hours). [ 2 ] Researchers have estimated that a ChatGPT query consumes about five times more electricity than a simple web search. [ 3 ] Other researchers have estimated a request made via ChatGPT, uses 10 times as much electricity as a Google Search. [ 4 ] Microsoft and Meta had similar increases in their carbon footprint, similarly attributed to AI. [ 1 ] In June 2025, OpenAI executive Sam Altman stated that the average ChatGPT query used about 0.34 Wh (1.2 kJ ) of electricity and 8.5 × 10 −5 US gal (0.32 ml ) of water. [ 5 ] According to a study by Luccioni, Jernite and Strubell (2024), simple classification tasks performed by AI models consume on average 0.002 to 0.007 Wh per prompt (about 9% of a smartphone charge for 1,000 prompts). Text generation and text summarization each require around 0.05 Wh per prompt on average, while image generation is the most energy-intensive, averaging 2.91 Wh per prompt. The least efficient image generation model used 11.49 Wh per image, roughly equivalent to half a smartphone charge. [ 6 ] Researchers at the University of Michigan measured the energy consumption of various Meta Llama 3.1 models released in 2024 and found that smaller language models (8 billion parameters) use about 114 joules (0.03167 Wh) per response, while larger models (405 billion parameters) require up to 6,700 joules (1.861 Wh) per response. This corresponds to the energy needed to run a microwave oven for roughly one-tenth of a second and eight seconds, respectively. [ 7 ] According to researchers, the median Google Gemini text prompt in 2025 consumes about 0.24 Wh of electricity. Google’s improvements in software efficiency and its procurement of clean energy have reduced energy use by a factor of 33 and carbon emissions by a factor of 44 for a typical prompt over a year. In practical terms, the median Gemini text prompt uses roughly as much energy as watching nine seconds of television. [ 8 ] A 2024 Scientific Reports study compared the estimated carbon impacts of human writers and artists to those of select AI systems, and calculated that humans have 130 to 2900 times higher carbon impact. [ 9 ] A 2025 study criticized that comparison based on differences in output quality, and found a counterexample in completing programming tasks with GPT-4 , which had a carbon impact 5 to 19 times more than human programmers. [ 10 ] System level [ edit ] Carbon footprint [ edit ] See also: Offshore wind power on the Great Lakes AI has a significant carbon footprint due to growing electricity consumption , especially due to training and usage. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Researchers have argued that the carbon footprint of AI models during training should be considered when attempting to understand the impact of AI. [ 13 ] One study suggested that by 2027, energy costs for AI could increase to 85–134 Twh, nearly 0.5% of all current electricity usage. [ 14 ] [ 1 ] Training large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI generally requires much more electricity compared to running a single prediction on the trained model. [ 15 ] Using a trained model repeatedly, though, may easily multiply the electricity costs of predictions. [ 15 ] The computation required to train the most advanced AI models doubles every 3.4 months on average, leading to exponential power usage and resulting carbon footprint. [ 16 ] [ obsolete source ] Additionally, artificial intelligence algorithms running in places predominantly using fossil fuels for energy will exert a much higher carbon footprint than places with cleaner energy sources. [ 17 ] These models may be modified for less environmental impacts at the cost of accuracy, emphasizing the importance of finding the balance between accuracy and environmental impact. Recent research has shown that developing and training large language models can produce significant environmental impacts, including approximately 493 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions and 2.77 million liters of water use when considering the full lifecycle from hardware manufacturing to model training. [ 18 ] BERT , a language model trained in 2019, required \"the energy of a round-trip transcontinental flight\" to train. [ 19 ] GPT-3 released 552 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during training, \"the equivalent of 123 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for one year\". [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Much of the energy cost is due to inefficient model architectures and processors. [ 19 ] One model named BLOOM, from Hugging Face , trained with more efficient chips and, therefore, only released 25 metric tons of CO 2 . [ 20 ] Incorporating the energy cost of manufacturing the chips for the system doubled the carbon footprint, to \"the equivalent of around 60 flights between London and New York.\" [ 20 ] Operating BLOOM daily was estimated to release the equivalent carbon footprint as driving 54 miles. [ 20 ] Algorithms which have lower energy costs but run millions of times a day can also have significant carbon footprints. [ 20 ] Research in 2024 suggested the integration of AI into search engines could multiply energy costs significantly. [ 19 ] [ 22 ] Another estimate found that integrating ChatGPT into every Google search query would use 10 TWh each year, the equivalent yearly energy usage of 1.5 million European Union residents. [ 22 ] Increased computational demands from AI caused both increased water and energy usage, leading to significantly more demands on the grid. [ 23 ] Due to increased energy demands from AI-related projects, coal-fired plants in Kansas City [ 24 ] [ need quotation to verify ] and West Virginia [ 1 ] [ need quotation to verify ] pushed back closing. Other coal-fired plants in the Salt Lake City region have pushed back retirement of their coal-fired plants by up to a decade. [ 25 ] Environmental debates have raged in both Virginia and France about whether a \"moratorium\" should be called for additional data centers. [ 24 ] In 2024 at the World Economic Forum , Sam Altman gave a speech in which he said that the AI industry can only grow if there is a major technology breakthrough to increase energy development . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Carbon footprints of AI models depends on the energy source used, with data centers using renewable energy lowering their footprint. [ 16 ] Many tech companies claim to offset energy usage by buying energy from renewable sources, though some experts argue that utilities simply replace the claimed renewable energy with increased non-renewable sources for their other customers. [ 25 ] Analysis of the carbon footprint of AI models remains difficult to determine, as they are aggregated as part of datacenter carbon footprints, and some models may help reduce carbon footprints of other industries, [ 29 ] or due to differences in reporting from companies. [ 30 ] Some applications of ML, such as for fossil fuel discovery and exploration , may worsen climate change. [ 13 ] [ 21 ] Use of AI for personalized marketing online may also lead to increased consumption of goods , which could also increase global emissions. [ 21 ] Critics have highlighted that AI companies are also signing contracts with polluters to expand their production, thus increasing their environmental impact. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] A 2023 bibliographic report from Inria and CEA-Leti emphasizes that AI's carbon footprint must be assessed using full life cycle analysis (LCA), including hardware manufacturing, training energy, and deployment phases, rather than only operational emissions. [ 33 ] Energy use and efficiency [ edit ] Fueled by growth in artificial intelligence, data centres' demand for power increased in the 2020s. [ 34 ] According to the International Energy Agency data centres are expected to account for a relatively small share of global electricity demand growth by 2030. [ 35 ] Efficiency improvement of AI related computer chips, 2008–2023.  Index of energy intensity of AI computer chips (2008=100, log scale). [ 36 ] AI chips (i.e. GPUs ) use more energy and emit more heat than traditional CPU chips. [ 1 ] AI models with inefficiently implemented architectures or trained on less efficient chips may use more energy. [ 19 ] Since the 1940s, the energy efficiency of computation has doubled every 1.6 years. [ 37 ] The International Energy Agency (IEA) released its 2025 Electricity Analysis and Forecast in February 2025, projecting 4% growth in global electricity demand over the following three years due to data center growth, increased industrial production, increased electrification, and increased use of air conditioning . By 2027, energy consumption in the US is expected to grow by an amount equivalent to California's entire annual power usage, largely driven by energy-hungry data centers and manufacturing operations. In 2024, U.S. electricity generation rose by 3%, with data centers emerging as a dominant force behind the increase. Demand is expected to grow as semiconductor and battery manufacturing facilities increase production. [ 38 ] In 2024, a U.S. public policy group reported that artificial intelligence and other emerging industries with potential global economic influence are marked by high electricity consumption. As a result, U.S. energy policy is expected to focus on ensuring a reliable and sufficient electricity supply to support key sectors considered important for maintaining economic and technological competitiveness. [ 39 ] The rapid growth of artificial intelligence has led to a sharp increase in electricity demand, posing challenges for the sector’s continued expansion. In Northern Virginia, a major hub for AI data centers, the wait time to connect large facilities (those requiring over 100 megawatts) to the electrical grid has increased to seven years, reflecting pressure on existing energy infrastructure. Across the United States, utilities are experiencing the most substantial surge in electrical demand in decades. This strain is directly contributing to longer wait times for grid connections, complicating efforts to maintain the country's technological leadership in AI. The significance of these energy challenges extends beyond logistics. [ 40 ] A New York Times editorial emphasized the critical role of energy infrastructure, stating that \"Electricity is more than just a utility; it's the bedrock of the digital era. If the United States truly wants to secure its leadership in A.I., it must equally invest in the energy systems that power it.\" [ 41 ] Globally, the electricity consumption of data centers rose to 460 terawatts in 2022. This would have made data centers the 11th largest electricity consumer in the world, between the nations of Saudi Arabia (371 terawatts) and France (463 terawatts), according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. [ 42 ] Decisions and strategies by individual companies [ edit ] In 2024, Google failed to reach key goals from their net zero plan as a result of their work with AI, [ 43 ] [ 44 ] and had a 48% increase in greenhouse gas emission attributable to their growth in AI. [ 23 ] [ 1 ] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission . If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act . [ 45 ] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the Palisades Nuclear Reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation. [ 46 ] In 2025, Microsoft unveiled plans to invest $80 billion in the development and expansion of data centers designed to support AI technologies. These facilities, critical to the advancement of AI, depend on vast networks of interconnected chip clusters and significant electrical power to operate efficiently. [ 47 ] Water usage [ edit ] Equinix AM3 & AM4 in Amsterdam , Netherlands Cooling AI servers can demand large amounts of fresh water which is evaporated in cooling towers . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] To minimize the use of water required for cooling, centers are adopting a closed-loop system where the water is reused. [ 48 ] Another major AI usage of freshwater is the manufacturing of semiconductor chips. Semiconductor chips act as processors for the large information models and their immense computational demands. [ 49 ] Currently, the average semiconductor chip costs roughly 8-10 gallons of water, as a result of production of these chips requiring ultra pure water. [ 50 ] This water is processed to remove molecular impurities and ions ; it takes between 1.4 and 1.6 gallons of freshwater to make 1 gallon of ultra pure water, which is then used to manufacture the chips. [ 51 ] In a 2023 paper, researchers projected that AI will withdraw [ a ] between 4.2 – 6.6 billion cubic meters of water in 2027, greater than half of the total water withdrawal of the United Kingdom. [ 52 ] The authors estimated that training GPT-3 , released by OpenAI in 2020, may have consumed 700,000 liters of water, and that 10–50 medium-length GPT-3 responses consume about 500 mL of fresh water, \"depending on when and where it is deployed\". [ 52 ] According to other researchers the median Google Gemini text prompt in 2025 consumes about five drops of water (0.26 milliliter). [ 8 ] One data center that Microsoft had considered building near Phoenix, due to increasing AI usage, was likely to consume up to 56 million gallons of fresh water each year, equivalent to the water footprints of 670 families. [ 53 ] Microsoft may have increased water consumption by 34% due to AI, while Google increased its water usage by 20% due to AI. [ 54 ] [ 16 ] Due to their Iowa data center cluster, Microsoft was responsible for 6% of the freshwater use in a local town. [ 54 ] A possible solution for reducing water consumption is to build data centers in colder countries that can offer a natural cooling system. For example, Facebook (now Meta ) built a data center in Luleå , northern Sweden, in 2011. [ 55 ] In addition, Google invested one more billion euros into the expansion of its data centre campus in Hamina in Finland in 2024, which was primarily created to adapt an old paper mill so that seawater would travel to the data centre's heat exchangers which then expelled the hot water back into the ocean for a full cycle, for a total of 4.5 billion euros invested in the site. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] E-waste [ edit ] Main article: Electronic waste Electronic waste (E-waste) due to production of AI hardware may also contribute to emissions. [ 16 ] The rapid growth of AI may also lead to faster deprecation of devices, resulting in hazardous e-waste. [ 59 ] Among the 62 million tonnes of e-waste produced in 2022, less than one quarter of the total mass was properly recycled. Worldwide, the annual generation of e-waste is rising by 2.6 million tonnes annually, on track to reach 82 million tonnes by 2030, a further 33% increase from the 2022 figure. [ 60 ] AI could have an important role because it is expected to add 1.2 million to 5 million metric tons of e-waste in total by 2030, which would represent up to 12% of global e-waste. [ 61 ] Some applications of AI, such as for robot recycling, may reduce e-waste. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Mining [ edit ] Large-scale AI is typically housed in data centres, which can exact heavy tolls on the planet. Their electronics rely on huge amounts of raw materials: making a 2 kg computer requires 800 kg of raw materials. In addition, the microchips that power AI require rare-earth elements [ example needed ] , often mined in environmentally destructive ways. [ 4 ] Social impact and environmental justice [ edit ] Environmental degradation caused by AI can negatively impact certain geographic regions more than others. [ 64 ] One-fifth of US data centers, which rely heavily on water for cooling, consume water from drought-stricken areas with moderate to high regional water stress . [ 65 ] [ 66 ] This increases the likelihood of seasonal water shortages in the public water supply of already-vulnerable regions. [ 67 ] Local environmental impacts in the communities where AI models are trained have included local air and water pollution, elevated carbon emissions and ozone, and worsening megadroughts . [ 68 ] Community activists have expressed concerns about the impact of AI on air quality, water access, and grid stability in marginalized neighborhoods that have historically suffered from industrial pollution . [ 69 ] A large data center owned by xAI has faced criticism for environmental racism due to the alleged inequitable pollution in the majority-Black and low-income community of Boxtown . [ 70 ] In 2025, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) and the NAACP filed a lawsuit against xAI, alleging that the company is depriving the community of its human rights of clean air and a healthy environment and is in violation of the Clear Air Act . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] The data center houses 35 methane gas turbines which are not equipped with pollution controls, [ 72 ] [ 73 ] and according to the SELC operated for months without air pollution permits. [ 74 ] Southwest Memphis has a cancer risk at four times the national average due to industrial contamination and air toxics exposure. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Climate solutions [ edit ] This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards . The specific problem is: Section makes broad claims without large-scale high quality evidence (i.e. Systematic Review). Please help improve this section if you can. ( August 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Despite concerns about its environmental footprint, AI has demonstrated capabilities in improving weather forecasting and climate analysis. Machine learning models can process vast amounts of meteorological data to enhance short-term weather predictions and identify atmospheric patterns that traditional numerical methods may miss. [ 77 ] These systems are being applied to model extreme weather events including floods, droughts, and heatwaves, enabling improved disaster preparedness and early warning systems. [ 78 ] AI algorithms are also being used to monitor environmental changes, including tracking deforestation, measuring polar ice melt, and monitoring emissions from various sources. [ 21 ] [ 79 ] Beyond generating climate insights, AI technologies are being deployed in emission reduction efforts. Google has developed Project Green Light, which uses AI to optimize traffic light timing to reduce stop-and-go traffic, potentially decreasing vehicle emissions at intersections. [ 80 ] Some climate scientists [ who? ] have suggested that AI could improve the efficiency of renewable energy systems, though concerns remain about AI's own substantial energy requirements. [ 81 ] AI is also being applied to genetic engineering. An AI tool called Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses (SLEAP) is being used to improve the carbon sequestration of plant root systems. [ 82 ] One machine learning project, the Open Catalyst project, has been used to identify \"suitable low-cost electrocatalysts\" for battery storage of renewable energy sources. [ 13 ] AI is also being explored to improve sustainability in environmentally intensive sectors such as food production and fast fashion by optimizing supply chains and reducing waste. [ 83 ] However, comprehensive frameworks for evaluating the net climate impact of AI systems, accounting for both their energy costs and potential environmental benefits, have yet to be widely adopted. [ 84 ] Conflict on the use of AI for environmental research [ edit ] There has been a growing divide in the scientific community over the different benefits AI can provide for environmental science and research. While potential benefits include AI powered research for the development of carbon sequestering plants and the use of AI to make collection of ecological data faster and more streamlined, there is disagreement over whether this offsets the detrimental affects AI usage has on the environment. [ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Policy and regulation [ edit ] United States [ edit ] The environmental impacts of AI have been a blindspot in the range of AI legislation proposed in the US Congress . As of November 2024, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024 introduced in the Senate by Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey was the only federal bill [ according to whom? ] to make environmental recommendations for the use of AI. The Act would have required the administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency , the National Institute of Standards and Technology , and the Department of Energy to study the environmental effects of AI's development, deployment, and post-deployment and enact a voluntary reporting system for AI-related environmental impacts. [ 90 ] The bill has not been reintroduced in the 119th Congress . In lieu of federal legislation on the subject, certain state governments have introduced policy on the environmental cost of AI. Virginia is considering legislation requiring data centers to submit water use estimates, reflecting growing concerns about resource consumption, sustainability, and land use. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] Another Virginia bill proposed a mandatory review and approval process from the State Corporation Commission (SCC) for data center developments exceeding 100 megawatts to ensure grid reliability. However, the House Labor and Commerce Committee unanimously voted against the bill, expressing concerns that it might deter data center investments in the state. [ 93 ] Additionally, House Bill 2035, introduced in the Virginia General Assembly , would require data centers to report quarterly on water and energy use to the Department of Environmental Quality , with the information made publicly accessible. [ 94 ] European Union [ edit ] The European Union (EU) intends to regulate the environmental impact of artificial intelligence on multiple levels of government. The European Green Deal (EGD), set forth by the European Commission and approved in 2020, states its intention to utilize AI and other information and communication technology (ICT) to advance sustainability goals. Partnerships between the Commission and various European environmental and IT groups culminated in the development of the Green Deal Data Space (GDDS). As part of the European Data Portal , the GDDS project aims to aggregate cross-sectorial data in environmental and climate science to support the policy goals set forth in the EGD. AI agents can use the portal to find trends in the data and make recommendations to policymakers. [ 95 ] Policy research undertaken at the request of the European Commission recommends the EU take a bolder stance against the environmental costs of AI. One ethics report advocates that AI systems \"should take into account the environment, including other living beings, and their social and societal impact should be carefully considered.\" [ 95 ] Other reports by EU sources and independent watchdogs point to the  of environmental considerations in AI model prohibitions set forth in the European Artificial Intelligence Act , and advocate for the assessment of environmental risks posed by the proliferation of AI systems. [ 96 ] A 2022 case study recommends the EU restrict market access for AI systems that fail to implement global emissions monitoring or reduction strategies, along with mandated efficiency improvements, industry-wide sustainability reporting, and standardized life-cycle assessments (LCAs). [ 97 ] EU member states maintain individualized national AI strategies, many of which include sustainability goals. France [ edit ] France devises general environmental priorities in its national AI strategy report. Notably, it advocates that AI and data system development should be sustainably designed from the onset to support \"the ecological transition of the European cloud industry.\" Furthermore, the report advocates for the publication of \"ecological data\" to promote AI-driven environmental solutions. The report also includes France's intention to support the adoption of AI for a more efficient grid and renewable energy transition. [ 98 ] Germany [ edit ] Germany published its national AI strategy in December 2020 which includes dedicated sections on the environmental impacts of AI. These begin with the federal government's intention to thoroughly research and develop AI systems that can be used to promote energy efficiency, conservation, a circular economy, partnerships with higher education, natural resource management, and progress toward United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A subsequent section emphasizes the need for a reduction of energy consumption and a standardized environmental impact assessment (EIA) to create a net carbon-negative AI ecosystem. [ 99 ] Germany also operates the \"AI Lighthouses\" program which issues grants directly to businesses, non-profits, and researchers utilizing AI to develop environmental solutions. As of 2024, the German German Federal Environmental Ministry (BMUKN) has disbursed upwards of 70 million euros in funding through the initiative. [ 100 ] Italy [ edit ] The Italian national strategy for AI, crafted by a dedicated working group appointed by the Ministry of Economic Development (MISE), aims to leverage Italy's advantage in AI research and development to regain momentum in achieving its SDGs. The report principally advocates for government-backed stimulus in the development of AI for sustainability.
