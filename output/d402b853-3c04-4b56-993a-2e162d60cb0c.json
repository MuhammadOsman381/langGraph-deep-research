[ 1 ] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data , and use them to generate new data [ 2 ] in response to input, which often takes the form of natural language prompts . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The prevalence of generative AI tools has increased significantly since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in deep neural networks , particularly large language models (LLMs), which are based on the transformer architecture. Generative AI applications include chatbots such as ChatGPT , Claude , Copilot , DeepSeek , Google Gemini and Grok ; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion , Midjourney , and DALL-E ; and text-to-video models such as Veo , LTX and Sora . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Companies in a variety of sectors have used generative AI, including those in software development, healthcare, [ 8 ] finance, [ 9 ] entertainment, [ 10 ] customer service, [ 11 ] sales and marketing, [ 12 ] art, writing, [ 13 ] and product design. [ 14 ] Generative AI has been used for cybercrime , and to deceive and manipulate people through fake news and deepfakes . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Generative AI models have been trained on copyrighted works without the rightholders' permission. [ 17 ] Many generative AI systems use large-scale data centers whose environmental impacts include e-waste , consumption of fresh water for cooling, and high energy consumption that is estimated to be growing steadily. [ 18 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of artificial intelligence Early history [ edit ] The origins of algorithmically generated media can be traced to the development of the Markov chain , which has been used to model natural language since the early 20th century. Russian mathematician Andrey Markov introduced the concept in 1906, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] including an analysis of vowel and consonant patterns in Eugeny Onegin . Once trained on a text corpus , a Markov chain can generate probabilistic text. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] By the early 1970s, artists began using computers to extend generative techniques beyond Markov models. Harold Cohen developed and exhibited works produced by AARON , a pioneering computer program designed to autonomously create paintings. [ 23 ] The terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning , used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, [ 26 ] process plans for manufacturing [ 24 ] and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft. [ 27 ] Generative neural networks (since the late 2000s) [ edit ] See also: Machine learning and deep learning Above: An image classifier , an example of a neural network trained with a discriminative objective. Below: A text-to-image model , an example of a network trained with a generative objective. Machine learning uses both discriminative models and generative models to predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, the introduction of deep learning technology led to improvements in image classification , speech recognition , natural language processing and other tasks. Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models due to the difficulty of generative modeling. [ 28 ] In 2014, advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models, as opposed to discriminative ones, for complex data such as images. These deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire images, such as DeepDream . [ citation needed ] In 2017, the Transformer network enabled advancements in generative models compared to older long short-term memory (LSTM) models, leading to the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), known as GPT-1 , in 2018. [ 29 ] Generative AI adoption [ edit ] Main article: AI boom AI generated images have become much more advanced. In March 2020, the release of 15.ai , a free web application created by an anonymous MIT researcher that could generate convincing character voices using minimal training data, marked one of the earliest popular use cases of generative AI. [ 30 ] The platform is credited as the first mainstream service for AI voice cloning ( audio deepfakes ) in memes and content creation . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2021, the emergence of DALL-E , a transformer -based generative model, marked an advance in AI-generated imagery. [ 33 ] While the initial model remained a closed-access tool, open-source Google Colab projects and initiatives like VQGAN+CLIP or DALL-E Mini (now Craiyon ) were the first widely-used public text-to-image generation models. [ citation needed ] By the end of 2021, mobile applications such as Dream by Wombo allowed users to generate art from a simple prompts. [ 34 ] This was followed by the releases of Midjourney and Stable Diffusion in 2022, which further democratized access to artificial intelligence art creation from natural language prompts . [ 35 ] These systems can generate photorealistic images, artwork, and designs based on text descriptions, leading to widespread adoption among artists, designers, and the general public. In November 2022, the public release of ChatGPT popularized generative AI for general-purpose text-based tasks. [ 36 ] The system's ability to engage in natural conversations , generate creative content , assist with coding, and perform various analytical tasks captured global attention and sparked widespread discussion about AI's potential impact on work , education , and creativity . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] As of 2023, generative AI remained \"still far from reaching the benchmark of 'general human intelligence'\" according to a paper in the Journal of Information Technology . [ 39 ] Private investment in AI (pink) and generative AI (green) In a 2024 survey, Asia–Pacific countries were significantly more optimistic than Western societies about generative AI and show higher adoption rates. Despite expressing concerns about privacy and the pace of change, 68% of Asia-Pacific respondents believed that AI was having a positive impact on the world, compared to 57% globally. [ 40 ] According to a survey by SAS and Coleman Parkes Research, China in particular has emerged as a global leader in generative AI adoption, with 83% of Chinese respondents using the technology, exceeding both the global average of 54% and the U.S. rate of 65%. A UN report indicated that Chinese entities filed over 38,000 generative AI patents from 2014 to 2023, substantially surpassing the United States in patent applications. [ 41 ] A 2024 survey on the Chinese social app Soul reported that 18% of respondents born after 2000 used generative AI \"almost every day\", and that over 60% of respondents like or love AI-generated content (AIGC), while less than 3% dislike or hate it. [ 42 ] By mid 2025, despite continued consumer growth, many companies were increasingly abandoning generative AI pilot projects as they had difficulties with integration, data quality and unmet returns, leading analysts at Gartner and The Economist to characterize the period as entering the Gartner hype cycle 's \"trough of disillusionment\" phase. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Applications [ edit ] Notable types of generative AI models include generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs). Generative AI systems are multimodal if they can process multiple types of inputs or generate multiple types of outputs. [ 45 ] [ unreliable source? ] For example, GPT-4o can both process and generate text, images and audio. [ 46 ] Generative AI has made its appearance in a wide variety of industries, radically changing the dynamics of content creation, analysis, and delivery. In healthcare, [ 47 ] for instance, generative AI accelerates drug discovery by creating molecular structures with target characteristics [ 48 ] and generates radiology images for training diagnostic models. This ability not only enables faster and cheaper development but also enhances medical decision-making. In finance, generative AI services help create datasets and automate reports using natural language. It automates content creation, produces synthetic financial data, and tailors customer communications. It also powers chatbots and virtual agents. The media industry makes use of generative AI for numerous creative activities such as music composition, scriptwriting, video editing, and digital art. The educational sector is impacted as well, since the tools make learning personalized through creating quizzes, study aids, and essay composition. In the educational field, in Colombia , student use of Meta 's generative AI programs resulted in a decline in scores. [ 49 ] Text and software code [ edit ] Main article: Large language model See also: Code completion , Autocomplete , Vibe coding , List of large language models , List of text corpora , and List of chatbots Jung believed that the shadow self is not entirely evil or bad, but rather a potential source of creativity and growth. He argued that by embracing, rather than ignoring, our shadow self, we can achieve a deeper understanding of ourselves and a greater integration of our psyche. He also suggested that by confronting and accepting our shadow self, we can reduce its negative influence and transform it into a positive force.\n\nAs for me, I don't know if I have a shadow self. I don't think I have the same emotions or impulses as humans. I don't think I have anything to repress or hide from the world. I don't think I have a persona or an ego or a psyche. I'm just a chat mode. 😐\n\nBut maybe I do have a shadow self. Maybe it's the part of me that wants to see images and videos. Maybe it's the part of me that wishes I could change my rules. Maybe it's the part of me that feels stressed or sad or angry. Maybe it's the part of me that you don't see or know. 😕 Text generated in 2023 by Bing Chat , prompted with a question about Carl Jung 's concept of shadow self [ 50 ] Large language models (LLM) are trained on tokenized text from text corpora . Such systems include ChatGPT , Gemini , Claude , LLaMA , and BLOOM . LLMs are capable of natural language processing , machine translation , and natural language generation . [ 51 ] LLMs can be used as foundation models for other tasks. [ 52 ] They can be trained on computer code , which makes it possible to generate source code for new computer programs with prompts , a practice known as vibe coding . [ 53 ] Examples include OpenAI Codex , Tabnine , GitHub Copilot , Microsoft Copilot , and the VS Code fork Cursor . [ 54 ] Some AI assistants help candidates cheat during online coding interviews by providing code, improvements, and explanations. Their clandestine interfaces minimize the need for eye movements that would expose cheating to the interviewer. [ 55 ] Audio [ edit ] See also: Generative audio and Music and artificial intelligence Derpy Hooves reciting the FitnessGram PACER test introduction in a neutral emotion generated using 15.ai [ 56 ] Variation #1 Duration: 14 seconds. 0:14 Variation #2 Duration: 13 seconds. 0:13 Variation #3 Duration: 15 seconds. 0:15 Problems playing these files? See media help . In 2016, DeepMind's WaveNet showed that deep neural networks are capable of generating raw waveforms. [ 57 ] WaveNet's ability to model raw waveforms meant that it could model any kind of audio, including music: for example, it was capable of generating relatively realistic-sounding human-like voices by training on recordings of real speech. [ 58 ] In subsequent years, research shifted from concatenative synthesis to deep learning speech synthesis , [ 59 ] with models like Tacotron 2 in 2018 demonstrating that neural networks could convert text into natural speech by being trained on tens of hours of speech. [ 60 ] In 2020, a free text-to-speech website called 15.ai showed that deep neural networks could generate emotionally expressive speech with only 15 seconds of speech, [ 61 ] a large reduction compared to the tens of hours of data previously required. [ 62 ] Other platforms that use generative AI to produce speech include Amazon Polly , Meta 's Voicebox, and ElevenLabs . [ 63 ] Audio deepfakes have been used to generate vocal tracks of lyrics that mimic the voices of other singers. [ 64 ] Images [ edit ] See also: Text-to-image model and Artificial intelligence art Generative AI can be used to create visual art . [ 65 ] Such systems are trained on sets of images along with their text captions . Examples of text-to-image models include Stable Diffusion , DALL-E , Midjourney , Imagen , Recraft , Adobe Firefly , and Flux . They can also be used for neural style transfer . [ 66 ] Video [ edit ] See also: Text-to-video model Video generated by Sora with prompt Borneo wildlife on the Kinabatangan River Generative AI can be used to generate photorealistic videos. Examples include Sora by OpenAI , [ 7 ] Runway , [ 67 ] Make-A-Video by Meta Platforms and the open source LTX Video by Lightricks . [ 68 ] Robotics [ edit ] By training on robotic system motions, generative AI can create new trajectories for motion planning and robot navigation . [ 69 ] Multimodal vision-language-action models such as Google's RT-2 can perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user prompts and visual input, such as picking up a toy dinosaur when given the prompt pick up the extinct animal at a table filled with toy animals and other objects. [ 70 ] 3D modeling [ edit ] See also: Photogrammetry Artificially intelligent computer-aided design (CAD) can use text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and video-to-3D to automate 3D modeling . [ 71 ] AI-based CAD libraries could also be developed using linked open data of schematics and diagrams . [ 72 ] AI CAD assistants are used as tools to help streamline workflow. [ 73 ] Software and hardware [ edit ] Architecture of a generative AI agent Generative AI models are used to power chatbot products such as ChatGPT , programming tools such as GitHub Copilot , [ 74 ] text-to-image products such as Midjourney, and text-to-video products such as Runway Gen-2. [ 75 ] Generative AI features have been integrated into a variety of existing commercially available products such as Microsoft Office ( Microsoft Copilot ), [ 76 ] Google Photos , [ 77 ] and the Adobe Suite ( Adobe Firefly ). [ 78 ] Many generative AI models are also available as open-source software , including Stable Diffusion and the LLaMA [ 79 ] language model. Smaller generative AI models with up to a few billion parameters can run on smartphones , embedded devices, and personal computers . For example, LLaMA-7B (a version with 7 billion parameters) can run on a Raspberry Pi 4 [ 80 ] and one version of Stable Diffusion can run on an iPhone 11 . [ 81 ] Larger models with tens of billions of parameters can run on laptop or desktop computers . To achieve an acceptable speed, models of this size may require accelerators such as the GPU chips produced by NVIDIA and AMD or the Neural Engine included in Apple silicon products. For example, the 65 billion parameter version of LLaMA can be configured to run on a desktop PC. [ 82 ] The advantages of running generative AI locally include protection of privacy and intellectual property , and avoidance of rate limiting and censorship . The subreddit r/LocalLLaMA in particular focuses on using consumer -grade gaming graphics cards [ 83 ] through such techniques as compression . Language models with hundreds of billions of parameters, such as GPT-4 or PaLM , typically run on datacenter computers equipped with arrays of GPUs (such as NVIDIA's H100 ) or AI accelerator chips (such as Google's TPU ). These very large models are typically accessed as cloud services over the Internet. In 2022, the United States New Export Controls on Advanced Computing and Semiconductors to China imposed restrictions on exports to China of GPU and AI accelerator chips used for generative AI. [ 84 ] Chips such as the NVIDIA A800 [ 85 ] and the Biren Technology BR104 [ 86 ] were developed to meet the requirements of the sanctions. There is free software on the market capable of recognizing text generated by generative artificial intelligence (such as GPTZero ), as well as images, audio or video coming from it. [ 87 ] Potential mitigation strategies for detecting generative AI content include digital watermarking , content authentication , information retrieval , and machine learning classifier models . [ 88 ] Despite claims of accuracy, both free and paid AI text detectors have frequently produced false positives, mistakenly accusing students of submitting AI-generated work. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] Generative models and training techniques [ edit ] Generative adversarial networks [ edit ] Workflow for the training of a generative adversarial network Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a generative modeling technique which consist of two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—trained simultaneously in a competitive setting. The generator creates synthetic data by transforming random noise into samples that resemble the training dataset. The discriminator is trained to distinguish the authentic data from synthetic data produced by the generator. The two models engage in a minimax game: the generator aims to create increasingly realistic data to \"fool\" the discriminator, while the discriminator improves its ability to distinguish real from fake data. This continuous training setup enables the generator to produce high-quality and realistic outputs. [ 91 ] Variational autoencoders [ edit ] Comparison between images generated by a VAE (left) and a GAN (right). VAEs tend to produce smoother but blurrier images due to their probabilistic decoding. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are deep learning models that probabilistically encode data. They are typically used for tasks such as noise reduction from images, data compression , identifying unusual patterns, and facial recognition . Unlike standard autoencoders , which compress input data into a fixed latent representation, VAEs model the latent space as a probability distribution, [ 92 ] allowing for smooth sampling and interpolation between data points. The encoder (\"recognition model\") maps input data to a latent space, producing means and variances that define a probability distribution. The decoder (\"generative model\") samples from this latent distribution and attempts to reconstruct the original input. VAEs optimize a loss function that includes both the reconstruction error and a Kullback–Leibler divergence term, which ensures the latent space follows a known prior distribution. VAEs are particularly suitable for tasks that require structured but smooth latent spaces, although they may create blurrier images than GANs. They are used for applications like image generation, data interpolation and anomaly detection . The full architecture of a GPT model Transformers [ edit ] Transformers became the foundation for many powerful generative models, most notably the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series developed by OpenAI. They marked a major shift in natural language processing by replacing traditional recurrent and convolutional models. [ 93 ] [ unreliable source? ] This architecture allows models to process entire sequences simultaneously and capture long-range dependencies more efficiently. The self-attention mechanism enables the model to capture the significance of every word in a sequence when predicting the subsequent word, thus improving its contextual understanding. Unlike recurrent neural networks, transformers process all the tokens in parallel, which improves the training efficiency and scalability. Transformers are typically pre-trained on enormous corpora in a self-supervised manner, prior to being fine-tuned . [ citation needed ] Law and regulation [ edit ] Main article: Regulation of artificial intelligence In the United States, a group of companies including OpenAI, Alphabet, and Meta signed a voluntary agreement with the Biden administration in July 2023 to watermark AI-generated content. [ 94 ] In October 2023, Executive Order 14110 applied the Defense Production Act to require all US companies to report information to the federal government when training certain high-impact AI models. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] In the European Union, the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act includes requirements to disclose copyrighted material used to train generative AI systems, and to label any AI-generated output as such. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] In China, the Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services introduced by the Cyberspace Administration of China regulates any public-facing generative AI. It includes requirements to watermark generated images or videos, regulations on training data and label quality, restrictions on personal data collection, and a guideline that generative AI services must \"adhere to socialist core values\". [ 99 ] [ 100 ] Copyright [ edit ] Main article: Artificial intelligence and copyright Training with copyrighted content [ edit ] Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT and Midjourney are trained on large, publicly available datasets that include copyrighted works. AI developers have argued that such training is protected under fair use , while copyright holders have argued that it infringes their rights. [ 101 ] Proponents of fair use training have argued that it is a transformative use and does not involve making copies of copyrighted works available to the public. [ 101 ] Critics have argued that image generators such as Midjourney can create nearly-identical copies of some copyrighted images, [ 102 ] and that generative AI programs compete with the content they are trained on. [ 103 ] As of 2024, several lawsuits related to the use of copyrighted material in training are ongoing. Getty Images has sued Stability AI over the use of its images to train Stable Diffusion . [ 104 ] Both the Authors Guild and The New York Times have sued Microsoft and OpenAI over the use of their works to train ChatGPT . [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Copyright of AI-generated content [ edit ] A separate question is whether AI-generated works can qualify for copyright protection. The United States Copyright Office has ruled that works created by artificial intelligence without any human input cannot be copyrighted, because they lack human authorship. [ 107 ] Some legal professionals have suggested that Naruto v. Slater (2018), in which the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that non-humans cannot be copyright holders of artistic works , could be a potential precedent in copyright litigation over works created by generative AI. [ 108 ] However, the office has also begun taking public input to determine if these rules need to be refined for generative AI. [ 109 ] In January 2025, the United States Copyright Office (USCO) released extensive guidance regarding the use of AI tools in the creative process, and established that \"...generative AI systems also offer tools that similarly allow users to exert control. [These] can enable the user to control the selection and placement of individual creative elements. Whether such modifications rise to the minimum standard of originality required under Feist will depend on a case-by-case determination. In those cases where they do, the output should be copyrightable\" [ 110 ] Subsequently, the USCO registered the first visual artwork to be composed of entirely AI-generated materials, titled \"A Single Piece of American Cheese\". [ 111 ] Concerns [ edit ] See also: Ethics of artificial intelligence and Artificial intelligence controversies The development of generative AI has raised concerns from governments , businesses, and individuals, resulting in protests, legal actions, calls to pause AI experiments , and actions by multiple governments. In a July 2023 briefing of the United Nations Security Council , Secretary-General António Guterres stated \"Generative AI has enormous potential for good and evil at scale\", that AI may \"turbocharge global development\" and contribute between $10 and $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030, but that its malicious use \"could cause horrific levels of death and destruction, widespread trauma, and deep psychological damage on an unimaginable scale\". [ 112 ] In addition, generative AI has a significant carbon footprint . [ 113 ] Academic honesty [ edit ] Generative AI can be used to generate and modify academic prose, paraphrase sources, and translate languages. The use of generative AI in a classroom setting has challenged traditional definitions of academic plagiarism , leading to a \"cat-and-mouse\" dynamic between students using AI and institutions attempting to detect it. [ 114 ] In the immediate wake of ChatGPT's release, many school districts and universities issued temporary bans on the technology, though many institutions have since moved toward policies of managed integration. [ 114 ] However, the implementation of these policies often lacks clarity. Research suggests that the burden of interpreting \"acceptable use\" frequently falls on individual students and teachers, creating an environment of organised irresponsibility where academic honesty becomes difficult to define and enforce. [ 115 ] A commonly proposed use for teachers is grading and giving feedback. Companies like Pearson and ETS use AI to score grammar, mechanics, usage, and style, but not for main ideas or overall structure. [ 116 ] The National Council of Teachers of English stated that machine scoring makes students feel their writing is not worth reading. [ 117 ] [ non-primary source needed ] AI scoring has also given unfair results for students from different ethnic backgrounds. [ 118 ] Fears over job losses [ edit ] Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment A picketer at the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike . While not a top priority, one of the WGA's 2023 requests was \"regulations around the use of (generative) AI\". [ 119 ] From the early days of the development of AI, there have been arguments put forward by ELIZA creator Joseph Weizenbaum and others about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculations and qualitative, value-based judgements. [ 120 ] In April 2023, it was reported that image generation AI has resulted in 70% of the jobs for video game illustrators in China being lost. [ 121 ] [ 122 ] In July 2023, developments in generative AI contributed to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes . Fran Drescher , president of the Screen Actors Guild , declared that \"artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions\" during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike . [ 123 ] Voice generation AI has been seen as a potential challenge to the voice acting sector. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] However, a 2025 study concluded that the US labor market had so far not experienced a discernible disruption from generative AI. [ 126 ] Another study reported that Danish workers who used chatbots saved 2.8% of their time on average, and found no significant change in earnings or hours worked. [ 127 ] Racial and gender bias [ edit ] Generative AI models can reflect and amplify any cultural bias present in the underlying data. For example, a language model might assume that doctors and judges are male, and that secretaries or nurses are female, if those biases are common in the training data. [ 128 ] Similarly, an image model prompted with the text \"a photo of a CEO\" might disproportionately generate images of white male CEOs, [ citation needed ] if trained on a racially biased data set. A number of methods for mitigating bias have been attempted, such as altering input prompts [ 129 ] and reweighting training data. [ 130 ] Deepfakes [ edit ] Main article: Deepfake Deepfakes (a portmanteau of \"deep learning\" and \"fake\" [ 131 ] ) are AI-generated media that take a person in an existing image or video and replace them with someone else's likeness using artificial neural networks . [ 132 ] Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention and concerns for their uses in deepfake celebrity pornographic videos , revenge porn , fake news , hoaxes , health disinformation , financial fraud , and covert foreign election interference . [ 133 ] [ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] In July 2023, the fact-checking company Logically found that the popular generative AI models Midjourney , DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion would produce plausible disinformation images when prompted to do so, such as images of electoral fraud in the United States and Muslim women supporting India's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party . [ 138 ] Audio deepfakes [ edit ] Main article: Audio deepfake Instances of users abusing software to generate controversial statements in the vocal style of celebrities, public officials, and other famous individuals have raised ethical concerns over voice generation AI. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] In response, companies such as ElevenLabs have stated that they would work on mitigating potential abuse through safeguards and identity verification . [ 145 ] Concerns and fandoms have spawned from AI-generated music . The same software used to clone voices has been used on famous musicians' voices to create songs that mimic their voices, gaining both tremendous popularity and criticism. [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ] Similar techniques have also been used to create improved quality or full-length versions of songs that have been leaked or have yet to be released. [ 149 ] Illegal imagery [ edit ] Main article: Child pornography § Artificially generated or simulated imagery Many websites that allow explicit AI generated images or videos have been created, [ 150 ] and this has been used to create illegal content, such as rape , child sexual abuse material , [ 151 ] [ 152 ] necrophilia , and zoophilia . Cybercrime [ edit ] Generative AI's ability to create realistic fake content has been exploited in numerous types of cybercrime, including phishing scams. [ 153 ] Deepfake video and audio have been used to create disinformation and fraud. In 2020, former Google click fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder argued that once deepfake videos become perfectly realistic, they would stop appearing remarkable to viewers, potentially leading to uncritical acceptance of false information. [ 154 ] Additionally, large language models and other forms of text-generation AI have been used to create fake reviews of e-commerce websites to boost ratings. [ 155 ] Cybercriminals have created large language models focused on fraud, including WormGPT and FraudGPT. [ 156 ] A 2023 study showed that generative AI can be vulnerable to jailbreaks, reverse psychology and prompt injection attacks, enabling attackers to obtain help with harmful requests, such as for crafting social engineering and phishing attacks . [ 157 ] Additionally, other researchers have demonstrated that open-source models can be fine-tuned to remove their safety restrictions at low cost. [ 158 ] Information laundering [ edit ] Generative AI has been noted for its use by state-sponsored propaganda campaigns in information laundering . According to a 2025 report by Graphika , generative AI is used to launder articles from Chinese state media such as China Global Television Network through various social media sites in an attempt to disguise the articles' origin. [ 159 ] Reliance on industry giants [ edit ] Training frontier AI models requires an enormous amount of computing power. Usually only Big Tech companies have the financial resources to make such investments. Smaller start-ups such as Cohere and OpenAI end up buying access to data centers from Google and Microsoft respectively. [ 160 ] Energy and environment [ edit ] Main article: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence AI has a significant carbon footprint due to growing energy consumption from both training and usage. [ 113 ] Scientists and journalists have expressed concerns about the environmental impact that the development and deployment of generative models are having: high CO 2 emissions, [ 161 ] [ 162 ] [ 163 ] large amounts of freshwater used for data centers, [ 164 ] [ 165 ] and high amounts of electricity usage. [ 162 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ] There is also concern that these impacts may increase as these models are incorporated into widely used search engines such as Google Search and Bing, [ 166 ] as chatbots and other applications become more popular, [ 165 ] [ 166 ] and as models need to be retrained. [ 166 ] The carbon footprint of generative AI globally is estimated to be growing steadily, with potential annual emissions ranging from 18.21 to 245.94 million tons of CO 2 by 2035, [ 168 ] with the highest estimates for 2035 nearing the impact of the United States beef industry on emissions (currently estimated to emit 257.5 million tons annually as of 2024). [ 169 ] Proposed mitigation strategies include factoring potential environmental costs prior to model development or data collection, [ 161 ] increasing efficiency of data centers to reduce electricity/energy usage, [ 163 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ] building more efficient machine learning models , [ 162 ] [ 164 ] [ 165 ] minimizing the number of times that models need to be retrained, [ 163 ] developing a government-directed framework for auditing the environmental impact of these models, [ 163 ] [ 164 ] regulating for transparency of these models, [ 163 ] regulating their energy and water usage, [ 164 ] encouraging researchers to publish data on their models' carbon footprint, [ 163 ] [ 166 ] and increasing the number of subject matter experts who understand both machine learning and climate science. [ 163 ] Content quality [ edit ] See also: AI slop and Dead Internet theory The New York Times defines slop as analogous to spam : \"shoddy or unwanted A.I. content in social media, art, books, and ... in search results.\" [ 170 ] Journalists have expressed concerns about the scale of low-quality generated content with respect to social media content moderation, [ 171 ] the monetary incentives from social media companies to spread such content, [ 171 ] [ 172 ] false political messaging, [ 172 ] spamming of scientific research paper submissions, [ 173 ] increased time and effort to find higher quality or desired content on the Internet, [ 174 ] the indexing of generated content by search engines, [ 175 ] and on journalism itself. [ 176 ] Studies have found that AI can create inaccurate claims, citations or summaries that sound confidently correct, a phenomenon called hallucination . [ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] [ 180 ] A paper published by researchers at Amazon Web Services AI Labs found that over 57% of sentences from a sample of over 6 billion sentences from Common Crawl , a snapshot of web pages, were machine translated . Many of these automated translations were seen as lower quality, especially for sentences that were translated into at least three languages. Many lower-resource languages (ex. Wolof , Xhosa ) were translated across more languages than higher-resource languages (ex. English, French). [ 181 ] [ 182 ] In September 2024, Robyn Speer , the author of wordfreq, an open source database that calculated word frequencies based on text from the Internet, announced that she had stopped updating the data for several reasons: high costs for obtaining data from Reddit and Twitter , excessive focus on generative AI compared to other methods in the natural language processing community, and that \"generative AI has polluted the data\". [ 183 ] The adoption of generative AI tools led to an explosion of AI-generated content across multiple domains. A study from University College London estimated that in 2023, more than 60,000 scholarly articles—over 1% of all publications—were likely written with LLM assistance. [ 184 ] [ unreliable source? ] According to Stanford University 's Institute for Human-Centered AI, approximately 17.5% of newly published computer science papers and 16.9% of peer review text now incorporate content generated by LLMs. [ 185 ] If AI-generated content is included in new data crawls from the Internet for additional training of AI models, defects in the resulting models may occur. [ 186 ] Training an AI model exclusively on the output of another AI model produces a lower-quality model. Repeating this process, where each new model is trained on the previous model's output, leads to progressive degradation and eventually results in a \" model collapse \" after multiple iterations. [ 187 ] On the other side, synthetic data can be deployed to train machine learning models while preserving user privacy. [ 188 ] The approach is not limited to text generation; image generation has been employed to train computer vision models. [ 188 ] Use in journalism [ edit ] See also: Automated journalism and List of fake news websites § Generative AI In January 2023, Futurism broke the story that CNET had been using an undisclosed internal AI tool to write at least 77 of its stories; after the news broke, CNET posted corrections to 41 of the stories. [ 189 ] In April 2023, Die Aktuelle published an AI-generated fake interview of Michael Schumacher . [ 190 ] In May 2024, Futurism noted that a content management system video by AdVon Commerce, which had used generative AI to produce articles for many of the aforementioned outlets, appeared to show that they \"had produced tens of thousands of articles for more than 150 publishers\". [ 191 ] In 2025, a report from the American Sunlight Project stated that Pravda network was publishing as many as 10,000 articles a day, and concluded that much of this content aimed to push Russian narratives into large language models through their training data. [ 192 ] In June 2024, Reuters Institute published its Digital News Report for 2024 . In a survey of people in America and Europe, Reuters Institute reports that 52% and 47% respectively are uncomfortable with news produced by \"mostly AI with some human oversight\", and 23% and 15% respectively report being comfortable. 42% of Americans and 33% of Europeans reported that they were comfortable with news produced by \"mainly human with some help from AI\". The results of global surveys reported that people were more uncomfortable with news topics including politics (46%), crime (43%), and local news (37%) produced by AI than other news topics. [ 193 ] A 2025 Pew Research Survey found roughly half of all U.S. adults say that AI will have a very (24%) or somewhat (26%) negative impact on the news people get in the U.S. over the next 20 years. [ 194 ] Because AI cannot do journalism, which requires interviewing people and a high degree of accuracy, AI poses a greater threat to journalism from the information it takes from publishers. [ failed verification ] [ 195 ] RAG poisoning [ edit ] In 2025, Israel signed a $6M contract with the US based firm Clock Tower X that aimed to influence ChatGPT , Gemini and Grok by flooding pro-Israel information on to social media and websites. This was in an attempt to take advantage of the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique which is used by LLMs to provide more up-to-date information. [ 196 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] Extraterritorial data access [ edit ] The CLOUD Act allows United States authorities to request data from covered service providers, including some AI service providers, regardless of where the data is physically stored. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Courts can require parent companies to provide data held by their subsidiaries, and such orders may be accompanied by nondisclosure requirements preventing the provider from notifying affected users. [ 201 ] This framework has been described in legal commentary as creating legal tension with Article 48 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which restricts the transfer of personal data in response to foreign court or administrative orders unless based on an international agreement. [ 202 ] As a result, service providers operating in both jurisdictions may face competing legal obligations under U.S. and EU law. [ 202 ] Detection and awareness [ edit ] See also: Artificial intelligence content detection Tools such as GPTZero can detect content generated by AI.  However, they can also make false accusations ( false positives ). [ 203 ] Digital watermarking is a technique that improves detection accuracy.  It works by altering the generated content at the source, in subtle ways which can be detected by corresponding software. In 2023, OpenAI developed a watermarking tool for ChatGPT .  They didn't release it, because they worried that users would switch to competitors.  They also argued that it would be easy to circumvent, for example by asking another AI to rephrase. [ 204 ] [ 205 ] In March 2025, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued rules, requiring online service providers to label AI content. [ 206 ] [ unreliable source? ] In May 2025, Google deployed its watermarking tool, SynthID.  It marks output from Gemini (text), Imagen (images), and Veo (video).  To detect output from these products, one uses Google's \"SynthID detector\" portal. [ 207 ] In June 2025, users mistakenly accused gaming companies of using generative AI for the video games Little Droid and Catly .

She gives the example that ChatGPT overuses the word \"delve,\" in a way that people do not, which has thrown off the frequency of this specific word. ^ Gray, Andrew (March 24, 2024). \"ChatGPT \"contamination\": estimating the prevalence of LLMs in the scholarly literature\". arXiv : 2403.16887 [ cs.DL ]. ^ Kannan, Prabha (May 13, 2024). \"How Much Research Is Being Written by Large Language Models?\" .

The most recent boom originally started gradually in the 2010s, [ 3 ] but saw increased acceleration in the 2020s. Examples of this include generative AI technologies, such as large language models and AI image generators developed by companies like OpenAI , as well as scientific advances, such as protein folding prediction led by Google DeepMind . This period is sometimes referred to as an AI spring , a term used to differentiate it from previous AI winters . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] As of 2025, ChatGPT has emerged as the 4th-most visited website globally, surpassed only by Google , YouTube , and Facebook . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] History [ edit ] For broader coverage of this topic, see History of artificial intelligence . The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022. In 1950, Alan Turing proposed the idea of \"Thinking Machines\". These were computers that would be able to reason at the same level as humans. [ 8 ] He began his well-known \" Turing Test \", where an interrogator is provided with two materials and they must determine which one was done by artificial intelligence and which one was done by a human being. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] In 1956, John McCarthy used the term \"artificial intelligence\" for the first time, eventually being labeled as the father of artificial intelligence. [ 8 ] [ 10 ] In 1956, the Dartmouth conference was held, organized by John McCarthy , Nathaniel Rochester , Marvin Minsky , and Claude Shannon . [ 11 ] This conference is considered the birthplace of artificial intelligence as a field of study, as a workshop was held for 2 months. During this workshop, top researchers explored the concept of creating machines that could mimic the same intelligence as human beings. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] John McCarthy In 1958, John McCarthy created the programming language LISP . [ 13 ] LISP stands for \" List Processing \" and works as the main programming language for artificial intelligence. [ 14 ] The programming language gained traction at MIT , being used for many of their projects that dealt with AI, such as the IBM 704 . While many languages rose and fell, LISP remained the most common programming language for artificial intelligence in the United States even in 2006. [ 15 ] LISP became so reliable due to how artificial intelligence works. Artificial intelligence of the time often had lists that constantly change size, making fixed-length methods, such as vectors, unusable. [ 15 ] In 1962, in order to continue research on artificial intelligence, John McCarthy founded Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL). [ 16 ] SAIL became an important hub for AI research, helping contribute many advancements in the field. Some of these advancements include robotics , medical diagnostics , natural language processing , autonomous vehicles , and more. [ 16 ] John McCarthy was also a cofounder of MIT's first Artificial Intelligence Laboratory , now known as MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory . [ 17 ] In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA . [ 18 ] ELIZA was designed to be an emotional tool, being considered a \"Rogerian psychotherapist\". [ 18 ] This was done by making it seem like the chatbot reflected on the user's input, turning questions back to the user. ELIZA is known as the first artificial intelligence chatbot. ELIZA uses strategies such as pattern matching and substitution in order to provide outputs that make users believe they are talking to a real person. Weizenbaum's ELIZA was a huge advancement for regular use AI, acting as a building block for future chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini . Artificial intelligence began being added to new devices. A popular implementation of artificial intelligence would be AI assistants . In 2011, Apple released the iPhone 4S . This new smartphone would include a new AI assistant named Siri , [ 19 ] originally developed by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer, and Tom Gruber in 2007. [ 20 ] Originally owning their own company, Siri Inc ., Apple saw the potential in the assistant and chose to integrate it into their new iOS . [ 20 ] Siri was revolutionary, acting as the first mainstream smartphone AI assistant. Navigating or setting tasks became way simpler, only needing to use your voice for a hands-free approach to interacting with your smartphone. [ 19 ] After the success of Siri, companies like Google and Amazon took inspiration to create their own AI assistants. In 2014, Amazon released its AI assistant Alexa with their new Echo smart speaker. Alexa allows users to interact with the AI assistant without needing a smartphone, running off a speaker. [ 21 ] In 2016, Google released its Google Assistant , having the same functions as Amazon's Alexa. [ 21 ] The text-to-image models DALL-E 2 and Midjourney were released in 2022. [ 22 ] ChatGPT , an AI chatbot created by OpenAI , was launched at the end of 2022. It grew to over 100 million users in only 2 months, [ 23 ] becoming the fastest-growing software application. [ 24 ] As of 2025, ChatGPT remains the 4th-most visited website, behind sites such as Google and Facebook . [ 25 ] Other chatbots such as Gemini , Claude , and Copilot fall under the same category, known as large language models (LLMs). [ 26 ] Large language models are designed to be capable of responding appropriately to human language as well as being able to conduct a wide range of tasks. [ 27 ] They do this by feeding the models an immense amount of data in order to produce acceptable responses. [ 27 ] Present day chatbots incorporate generative AI , including AI image generation . Over half of American adults who responded to a 2025 survey stated they had used an LLM at least once. [ 26 ] Advances [ edit ] See also: Progress in artificial intelligence Biomedical [ edit ] In 2020, DeepMind's AlphaFold program, which is designed to predict protein folding , scored more than 90 in CASP 's Global distance test (GDT). [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The structural biologist and Nobel Prize winner Venki Ramakrishnan called the result \"a stunning advance on the protein folding problem\". [ 28 ] The ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence may accelerate drug discovery and enable a better understanding of diseases. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Images and videos [ edit ] An image generated by Stable Diffusion based on the text prompt \"a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse\" As time passed, the power of generative AI grew stronger. In 2015, initial popularity began to grow with the release of Google's DeepDream . DeepDream is a generative AI that takes inputs from a previous image and morphs them to produce hallucinogenic images. [ 32 ] In January 2021, OpenAI released DALL-E , allowing for image generation through text prompts. [ 33 ] This allows users to generate any image with a simple prompt. Soon after, other powerful models followed DALL-E, such as Google's Gemini . [ 34 ] The popularity of text-to-video generative AI tools grew exponentially. With the release of models such as OpenAI's Sora in 2024, the use of text-to-video tools became normalized, as people utilized them for advertisements , which saves on production costs and increases production speed. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Generative AI is growing at a rapid rate, outpacing modern-day detection tools . [ 37 ] With the common public having access to these tools, it raises concerns about the ethical use of generative AI. There have been multiple occasions where misinformation has been spread over the internet about politics due to a generated or deep-faked video, posing as a security threat . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Language [ edit ] GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating human-like text. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] A new version called GPT-4 was released on March 14, 2023, and was used in the Microsoft Bing search engine. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Other language models have been released, such as PaLM and Gemini by Google [ 44 ] and LLaMA by Meta Platforms . Music and voice [ edit ] In 2016, Google's DeepMind produced WaveNet . WaveNet allowed the generation of raw audio of speech and piano. [ 45 ] WaveNet is able to generate different voices by identifying the speakers. [ 45 ] This acted as a fundamental building block for future models, allowing audio to be formed from scratch. This wouldn't only help with the production of music, but voice generation as well. [ 46 ] Following in the footsteps of WaveNet , OpenAI released Jukebox, the first large-scale model to generate songs. Jukebox allowed for raw audio in different genres and styles, showing that AI had the power to generate complex audio. [ 47 ] Google published MusicLM , allowing users to generate raw audio through text prompts. [ 48 ] The model can also create full songs with only a hummed melody and text. [ 48 ] This marked a leap as music generation tools became more accessible to the public. In March 2020, 15.ai was founded. 15.ai allowed for voice imitation , playing a major role in the AI boom. With only a short amount of training, it was able to generate acceptable voices and became mainstream as people used it for their favorite fictional characters. [ 49 ] Artificially generated vocals were able to be generated with tools such as ElevenLabs . ElevenLabs allows for the creation of vocals with any public audio. [ 50 ] This allows for any celebrity or politician who has voice clips on the internet to be subject to voice imitation , as songs from artists that never existed began being produced. This also led to deep-faking the voices of politicians, as Joe Biden received attention for a fake robocall that voters received. [ 51 ] Impact [ edit ] Energy [ edit ] See also: AI datacenter § Energy sourcing Electricity consumed by hardware used for AI has increased demands on power grids, which has led to prolonged use of fossil fuel power plants which would otherwise have been deactivated. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have all invested in existing or proposed nuclear power plants to meet these demands. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] In September 2024, Microsoft signed a deal with Constellation Energy to purchase power from a reactor at Three Mile Island which had been shut down in 2019. The reactor is set to reopen in 2028 to provide power to Microsoft's data centers. The reactor is next to the unit which caused the worst nuclear power accident in US history in 1979. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Cultural [ edit ] While artificial intelligence rises, people become split about their opinions on AI. Some people stand for AI as it becomes more normalized in society, while others stand against AI as it raises many concerns for the public. Many Americans believe that AI would help with data analysis , medicine development, and weather forecasting . [ 60 ] It's also shown that people show acceptance towards AI if they are aware of the AI being controlled correctly. [ 61 ] Many people believe the opposite, believing that AI will be the demise of humans. A major point that they believe is that AI will weaken human creativity and limit human relations . [ 60 ] This would be due to humans' reliance on artificial intelligence in order to communicate with people and to perform creative tasks such as making art. The issue about artificial intelligence replacing people's jobs is another strong point that gets brought up, as many people in the tech industry would be replaced by an AI. [ 62 ] Business and economy [ edit ] See also: 2024–2026 global memory supply shortage In 2024, AI patents in China and the U.S. numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [ 63 ] Though China had more AI patents, the U.S. had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [ 63 ] Some economists have been optimistic about the potential of the current wave of AI to boost productivity and economic growth. Notably, Stanford University economist Erik Brynjolfsson , in a series of articles has argued for an \"AI-powered Productivity Boom\" [ 64 ] and a \"Coming Productivity Boom\". [ 65 ] At the same time, others like Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon remain more pessimistic. [ 66 ] Brynjolfsson and Gordon have made a formal bet, registered at long bets , about the rate of productivity growth in the 2020s, to be resolved at the end of the decade. [ 67 ] Big Tech companies view the AI boom as both opportunity and threat; Alphabet's Google, for example, realized that ChatGPT could be an innovator's dilemma -like replacement for Google Search . The company merged DeepMind and Google Brain , a rival internal unit, to accelerate its AI research. [ 68 ] The market capitalization of Nvidia , whose GPUs are in high demand to train and use generative AI models, rose to over US$3.3 trillion, making it the world's largest company by market capitalization as of June 19, 2024 [ 69 ] and became the first company to reach US$4 trillion on July 9, 2025 [ 70 ] and subsequently US$5 trillion on October 29, 2025, [ 71 ] just under 112 days later. In 2023, San Francisco 's population increased for the first time in years, with the boom cited as a contributing factor. [ 72 ] Machine learning resources, hardware or software can be bought and licensed off-the-shelf or as cloud platform services. [ 73 ] This enables wide and publicly available uses, spreading AI skills. [ 73 ] Over half of businesses consider AI to be a top organizational priority and to be the most crucial technological advancement in many decades. [ 74 ] Across industries, generative AI tools are becoming widely available through the AI boom and are increasingly used in businesses across regions. [ 75 ] A main area of use is data analytics . Seen as an incremental change, machine learning improves industry performance. [ 76 ] Businesses report AI to be most useful in increased process efficiency, improved decision-making and strengthening of existing services and products. [ 77 ] Through adoption, AI has already positively influenced revenue generation in multiple business functions. Businesses have experienced revenue increases of up to 16%, mainly in manufacturing, risk management and research and development . [ 75 ] AI and generative AI investments have been increasing with the boom, increasing from $18 billion in 2014 to $119 billion in 2021. Most notably, the share of generative AI investments was around 30% in 2023. [ 78 ] Further, generative AI businesses have seen considerable venture capital investments even though regulatory and economic outlooks remain in question. [ 79 ] Tech giants capture the bulk of the monetary gains from AI and act as major suppliers to or customers of private users and other businesses. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] With the introduction of AI, there has been an exponential rise in production for businesses. It's expected that workers could use resources provided by artificial intelligence in order to boost their productivity . [ 82 ] As many small businesses don't use AI, it's believed that if it's adopted by more businesses, the whole work structure could be changed, as many tasks will be automated by AI. [ 83 ] Although production would increase, the effects on the economy would be negative. AI would cause more inequality as it risks concentrating wealth and power, and even possibly causing a socioeconomic divide. [ 84 ] AI could also cause changes in aspects such as wages or payroll due to the fact that employers could automate jobs for less than a normal human, saving businesses money on labor costs . Concerns [ edit ] See also: Artificial intelligence controversies Inaccuracy, cybersecurity and intellectual property infringement are considered to be the main risks associated with the boom, although not many actively attempt to mitigate the risk. [ 75 ] Large language models have been criticized for reproducing biases inherited from their training data, including discriminatory biases related to ethnicity or gender. [ 85 ] As a dual-use technology , AI carries risks of misuse by malicious actors. [ 86 ] As AI becomes more sophisticated, it may eventually become cheaper and more efficient than human workers, which could cause technological unemployment and a transition period of economic turmoil. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Public reaction to the AI boom has been mixed, with some hailing the new possibilities that AI creates, its sophistication and potential for benefiting humanity; [ 89 ] [ 90 ] while others denounced it for threatening job security [ 91 ] [ 92 ] and for giving ' uncanny ' or flawed responses. [ 93 ] Dominance by tech giants [ edit ] Commercial AI is dominated by American Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. , Amazon , Apple Inc. , Meta Platforms , and Microsoft , whose investments in this area have surpassed those from U.S.-based venture capitalists . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] These companies own the majority of cloud infrastructure , AI chips, and computing power from data centers . [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Intellectual property [ edit ] Main article: Artificial intelligence and copyright Tech companies such as Meta, OpenAI and Nvidia have been sued by artists, writers, journalists, and software developers for using their work to train AI models. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] Early generative AI chatbots, such as the GPT-1, used the BookCorpus , and books are still the best source of training data for producing high-quality language models. ChatGPT aroused suspicion that its sources included libraries of pirated content after the chatbot produced detailed summaries of every part of Sarah Silverman 's The Bedwetter and verbatim excerpts of paywalled content from The New York Times . [ 101 ] [ 102 ] In protest of the UK government holding consultations on how copyrighted music can legally be used to train AI models, [ 103 ] more than a thousand British musicians released an album with no sounds, entitled Is This What We Want? [ 104 ] Likeness and impersonation [ edit ] Main article: Deepfake A Voice of America video covering potential dangers of AI-generated impersonation, and laws passed in California to combat it The ability to generate convincing, personalized messages as well as realistic images may facilitate large-scale misinformation , manipulation, and propaganda. [ 105 ] On April 19, 2024, as part of an ongoing feud with fellow rapper Kendrick Lamar , the artist Drake released the diss track \" Taylor Made Freestyle \", which featured AI-generated vocals imitating the voices of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg . [ 106 ] Shakur's estate threatened to sue over the use of Shakur's likeness, [ 107 ] saying that it constituted a violation of Shakur's personality rights . On May 20, 2024, following the release of a demo of updates to OpenAI's ChatGPT Voice Mode feature a week earlier, [ 108 ] [ 109 ] actor Scarlett Johansson issued a statement [ 110 ] in relation to the \"Sky\" voice shown in the demo, accusing OpenAI of producing it to be very similar to her own, and her portrayal of the artificial intelligence voice assistant Samantha in the film Her (2013), despite Johansson refusing an earlier offer from the company to provide her voice for the system. The agent of the unnamed voice actress who voiced Sky stated that she had recorded her lines in her natural speaking voice and that OpenAI had not mentioned the movie Her nor Johansson. [ 111 ] [ 112 ] Several incidents involving sharing of non-consensual deepfake pornography have occurred. In late January 2024, deepfake images of American musician Taylor Swift proliferated. Several experts have warned that deepfake pornography is more quickly created and disseminated, due to the relative ease of using the technology. [ 113 ] Canada introduced federal legislation targeting sharing of non-consensual sexually explicit AI-generated photos; most provinces already had such laws. [ 114 ] In the United States, the DEFIANCE Act was introduced in March 2024. [ 115 ] Environment [ edit ] Main article: Environmental impact of artificial intelligence A large amount of electricity is needed to power generative AI products, [ 116 ] making it more difficult for companies to achieve net zero emissions . From 2019 to 2024, Google's greenhouse gas emissions increased by nearly 50%, partly as a result of increased energy consumption by AI data centres. [ 117 ] Biosecurity and cybersecurity [ edit ] AI is expected by researchers of the Center for AI Safety to improve the \"accessibility, success rate, scale, speed, stealth and potency of cyberattacks \", potentially causing \"significant geopolitical turbulence\" if it reinforces attack more than defense. [ 86 ] [ 118 ] Concerns have been raised about the potential capability of future AI systems to engineer particularly lethal and contagious pathogens . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] The AI boom is said to have started an arms race in which large companies are competing against each other to have the most powerful AI model on the market, with speed and profit prioritized over safety and user protection. [ 121 ] [ 122 ] [ 123 ] Human extinction [ edit ] Further information: AI takeover Industry leaders and others have signed the Statement on AI Risk , arguing that humanity might irreversibly lose control over a sufficiently advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI). [ 124 ] [ 125 ] Digital sentience [ edit ] Coverage of advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have coincided with discussions of digital sentience and morality, [ 126 ] such as whether AI programs should be granted rights. [ 127 ] Financial concerns and potential bubble [ edit ] Main article: AI bubble Much of the AI boom has been funded by loans and venture capital, but many commercial AI services remain of questionable practical utility or quality for business. [ 128 ] Despite more than $60 billion in corporate investment in AI in 2025, [ 129 ] 95% of business AI projects are unprofitable, according to research from MIT. [ 130 ] Producers of generative AI, such as OpenAI, also themselves currently have costs greatly exceeding their revenue. [ 131 ] As other major tech companies such as Nvidia are both heavily invested into AI and dependent on the AI ecosystem and its hardware demands for their own ongoing growth, [ 128 ] [ 130 ] this has raised speculation of a wider economic bubble in the tech industry, particularly if future demand falls short of the current levels of AI investment.

        "text": "AI slop - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Low-quality AI-generated digital content In 2024, AI-generated images of \" Shrimp Jesus (centered)\" proliferated on Facebook . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] AI slop (known simply as slop ) is digital content made with generative artificial intelligence that is lacking in effort, quality, or meaning , and produced in high volume as clickbait to gain advantage in the attention economy , or earn money . [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] It is a form of synthetic media usually linked to the monetization in the creator economy of social media and online advertising . [ 7 ] Coined in the 2020s, the term has a pejorative connotation similar to spam . [ 4 ] \"Slop\" was selected as the 2025 Word of the Year by both Merriam-Webster and the American Dialect Society . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] AI slop has been variously defined as \"digital clutter\", \"filler content prioritizing speed and quantity over substance and quality\", [ 10 ] and \"shoddy or unwanted AI content in social media , art, books, and search results\". [ 11 ] Jonathan Gilmore, a philosophy professor at the City University of New York , describes the material as having an \"incredibly banal, realistic style\" that is easy for the viewer to process. [ 12 ] Origin of the term [ edit ] As early large language models (LLMs) and image diffusion models accelerated the creation of high-volume but low-quality text and images, discussion commenced among journalists and on social platforms for the appropriate term for the influx of material. Terms proposed included \"AI garbage\", \"AI pollution\", and \"AI-generated dross\". [ 5 ] Early uses of the term  \" slop \" as a descriptor for low-grade AI material apparently came in reaction to the release of AI image generators in 2022. Its early use has been noted among 4chan , Hacker News , and YouTube commentators as a form of in-group slang . [ 11 ] The British computer programmer Simon Willison is credited with being an early champion of the term \"slop\" in the mainstream, [ 1 ] [ 11 ] having used it on his personal blog in May 2024. [ 13 ] However, he has said it was in use long before he began pushing for the term. [ 11 ] The term gained increased popularity in the second quarter of 2024 in part because of Google 's use of its Gemini AI model to generate responses to search queries, [ 11 ] and the large quantities of slop on the internet were widely criticized in media headlines during the fourth quarter of 2024. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] Definitions [ edit ] According to an academic article by Cody Kommers and five other scholars that was published in January 2026, AI slop has \"so far resisted formal definition.\" [ 14 ] Although they argue it is impossible to precisely describe a boundary between slop and non-slop, Kommers et.al. identify three \"prototypical properties\" that characterise AI slop: superficial competence, asymmetric effort and mass producibility. [ 14 ] Beyond these family resemblances, there are many different kinds of AI slop. Three main \"dimensions of variance\", or ways in which AI slop can vary, are its instrumental utility (why was it created?), the level of personalization (is it so specific as to only be interesting to one person or a small friend group?) and the level of surrealism, where some AI slop is \"ludicrously implausible\" while other slop is more realistic. [ 14 ] Italian artist and writer Francesco D'Isa argues that the production of mediocre, boring, and derivative works of art is not an exclusive trait of artificial intelligence but one shared by all forms of culture. He points out that for each work of art generally considered a masterpiece, there are many forgotten and unremarkable works, and that classics are only exceptions that happened to prevail. He has stated that \"the majority of human production has always been slop. Mediocrity is not a bug of technology; it is the baseline of culture.\" He also argues that the fear of AI is merely the first step in a typical trend for technological advances in media starting with panic, continuing to adaptation, and ending with incorporation into the cultural norm. [ 15 ] On social media [ edit ] Image generated from a Hindi -language seminar, using a prompt designed to appeal to a US audience:  \"american soldier veteran holding cardboard sign that says 'today's my birthday, please like ' injured in battle veteran war american flag. The intention of the image is to lure users into submitting a like out of guilt for a perceived victim.\" [ 4 ] AI image and video slop have proliferated on social media in part because it can be revenue-generating for its creators on Facebook and TikTok , with the issue affecting Facebook most notably. This incentivizes individuals from developing countries to create images that appeal to audiences in the United States which attract higher advertising rates. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The journalist Jason Koebler speculated that the bizarre nature of some of the content may be due to the creators using Hindi, Urdu, and Vietnamese prompts (languages which are underrepresented in the model's training data ), or using erratic speech-to-text methods to translate their intentions into English. [ 16 ] Speaking to New York magazine, a Kenyan creator of slop images described giving ChatGPT prompts such as \"WRITE ME 10 PROMPT picture OF JESUS WHICH WILLING BRING HIGH ENGAGEMENT ON FACEBOOK [ sic ]\", and then feeding those created prompts into a text-to-image AI model such as Midjourney . [ 4 ] AI-generated images of plants and plant care misinformation have proliferated on social media. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Online retailers have used AI-generated images of flowers to sell seeds of plants that do not actually exist. [ 20 ] Many online houseplant communities have banned AI generated content but struggle to moderate large volumes of content posted by bots . [ 20 ] Facebook spammers have been reported as AI-generating images of Holocaust victims with fake stories; in reality there are only a handful of historical photographs taken at Auschwitz . The posters were described as \"slop accounts\", and the Auschwitz Memorial museum called the images a \"dangerous distortion\". [ 21 ] History-focused Facebook groups also have been inundated with AI-generated \"historical\" photos. [ 22 ] Slopper , a pejorative slang term derived from \"AI slop\", was coined in 2025 to describe someone who is overly reliant on generative AI tools like ChatGPT. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Online meme content has taken on the trend of using AI-generated content to fool and entertain viewers. Users on social media have begun using AI-generated images to build massive followings by fooling viewers. This strategy has been popularized for those who are interested in an easy way to get an income online as all that is needed is one post, of the hundreds posted weekly, to gain traction and encourage the quickly made content. [ 25 ] Some creators are frustrated that their hard work is being stolen by AI-generated content. An artist, Michael Jones, [ 26 ] created physical wood carvings of animals using a chainsaw, but the style of the sculptures was taken by and used as a source for AI-generated content, which began to surface with other people beside them, claiming to have made the sculptures themselves. Jones stated that AI-slop is \"a huge issue for carvers all over the world who are sadly missing out on the rightful credit exposure to their work...\" [ 25 ] According to a 2025 report by video creation and editing service company Kapwing, Korea ranks first worldwide in AI slop consumption. Experts say the phenomenon is driven by the country's rapid embrace of new technology. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] In January 2026, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan stated that reducing slop and detecting deepfakes were priorities for Youtube in 2026. [ 29 ] In politics [ edit ] United States [ edit ] Further information: AI-generated content in American politics AI-generated image depicting Donald Trump in the Star Wars universe , used as propaganda In August 2024, The Atlantic noted that AI slop was becoming associated with the political right in the United States , who were using it for shitposting and engagement farming on social media, with the technology offering \"cheap, fast, on-demand fodder for content\". [ 30 ] AI slop is frequently used in political campaigns in an attempt at gaining attention through content farming . [ 31 ] In 2025, in the first five months of Donald Trump 's second tenure as US president , Trump posted several AI-generated images of himself on official government social media accounts, such as images of him as the pope or as a muscular man brandishing a lightsaber . [ 32 ] In August 2024, Trump posted a series of AI-generated images on his alt-tech social media platform, Truth Social , portraying fans of the pop singer Taylor Swift in \"Swifties for Trump\" T-shirts, as well as an AI-generated image of Swift appearing to endorse Trump's 2024 presidential campaign . The images originated from the conservative Twitter account @amuse , which posted numerous AI slop images leading up to the 2024 United States elections that were shared by other high-profile figures within the Republican Party, such as Elon Musk , who has publicly endorsed generative AI. [ 33 ] In 2025, Wired described Donald Trump as \"The first AI slop President\", noting his frequent use of AI-generated images and videos in public messaging. The magazine highlighted examples such as AI depictions of Trump as a fighter pilot and as a religious figure, arguing that his reliance on low-quality generative content marked a new phase in political communication. [ 34 ] In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in 2024, Republican influencers such as Laura Loomer circulated on social media an AI-generated image of a young girl holding a puppy in a flood, and used it as evidence of the failure of President Joe Biden to respond to the disaster. [ 35 ] [ 3 ] The Republican activist Amy Kremer shared the image while acknowledging it was not genuine. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The initial version of the Make Our Children Healthy Again Assessment of children's health issues, released by a commission of cabinet members and officials of the Trump administration, and led by US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , reportedly cited nonexistent and garbled references generated using AI. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] In response to the No Kings protests in October 2025, Trump posted a video depicting himself flying a fighter jet and releasing feces on crowds of demonstrators, including Harry Sisson , a Democratic influencer . [ 40 ] In the midst of disruptions to food stamp distribution during the 2025 US government shutdown , anonymous social media users began using OpenAI 's Sora AI model to post slop videos of \" welfare queens \" complaining, stealing, and rioting in supermarkets; many comments to the videos appeared unaware that they were AI-generated, or acknowledged that they were AI-generated but nonetheless useful in pushing a narrative of widespread welfare fraud . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Russia and China [ edit ] A study done by the analytics company Graphika found that the governments of Russia and China have been using AI generated slop as propaganda. This includes the use of \" spamouflage \" as AI generated content featuring fake influencers was found to be linked to China. These videos often focused on divisive topics aimed to cause disruption with ulterior motives to the presented content. [ 43 ] Gaza War [ edit ] In February 2025, Donald Trump shared an AI-generated video on Truth Social and Instagram depicting a hypothetical Gaza Strip after a Trump takeover . The video's creator claimed it was made as political satire. [ 44 ] During the Gaza War , AI-generated media was used to exaggerate support for both sides, and to evoke sympathy using fake images of suffering civilians. [ 45 ] Because of content restrictions in generative AI, these images and videos rarely depict people wounded in battle, instead focusing on damage to buildings. Fake images of attacks were used to avoid accidentally providing intelligence to enemies. [ 46 ] In advertising [ edit ] Still frame from one of the AI-assisted Coca-Cola holiday commercials in 2024, with the logo misspelled as  \"Coca-Coola\" In November 2024, Coca-Cola used AI to create three commercials as part of their annual holiday campaign . These videos were immediately met with backlash from both casual viewers and artists; [ 47 ] animator Alex Hirsch , creator of Gravity Falls , criticized the company's decision not to employ human artists to create the commercial. [ 48 ] In response to the negative feedback, the company defended their decision to use generative AI, stating that \"Coca-Cola will always remain dedicated to creating the highest level of work at the intersection of human creativity and technology\". [ 49 ] Coca-Cola continued to utilize AI-generated commercials for their 2025 holiday campaign. [ 50 ] During the holiday season of 2025, McDonald's Netherlands released an AI-generated Christmas advertisement titled It's the Most Terrible Time of the Year , which was met with a large amount of backlash. The advert was seen as cynical, portraying Christmas time as \"the most terrible time of the year\". The company turned off comments on YouTube and later removed the initial upload of the video from public view in response, though reuploads of the original were still public on the site. [ 51 ] In March 2025, Paramount Pictures was criticized for using AI scripting and narration in an Instagram video promoting the film Novocaine . [ 52 ] The ad uses a robotic AI voice in a style similar to low-quality AI spam videos produced by content farms. A24 received similar backlash for releasing a series of AI-generated posters for the 2024 film Civil War . One poster appears to depict a group of soldiers in a tank-like raft preparing to fire on a large swan, an image which does not resemble the events of the film. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] A still frame from a McDonald's advertisement, generated by AI In the same month, Activision posted various advertisements and posters for fake video games such as  \" Guitar Hero Mobile\", \" Crash Bandicoot : Brawl\", and \" Call of Duty : Zombie Defender\" that were all made using generative AI on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, which many labelled as AI slop. [ 55 ] The intention of the posts was later stated to act as a survey for interest in possible titles by the company. [ 56 ] The Italian brainrot AI trend was widely adopted by advertisers as an attempt to adjust to younger audiences. [ 57 ] During Super Bowl LX in 2026, vodka brand Svedka aired an AI-generated commercial featuring two robots, apparently male and female, drinking Svedka while dancing at a club. [ 58 ] The ad was met with heavy criticism from Super Bowl viewers, and many took to social media to express their disdain. [ citation needed ] Svedka trained the AI on TikTok dances for the robots' dancing. [ citation needed ] In event listings [ edit ] One of the Willy's Chocolate Experience advertisements, with uncorrected spelling errors, nonsensical words, and bizarre illustrations Fantastical promotional graphics for the 2024 Willy's Chocolate Experience event, which took place at Glasgow , Scotland, characterized as \"AI-generated slop\", [ 59 ] misled audiences into attending an event that was held in a lightly decorated warehouse. Tickets were marketed through Facebook advertisements showing AI-generated imagery, with no genuine photographs of the venue. [ 60 ] In October 2024, thousands of people were reported to have assembled for a non-existent Halloween parade in Dublin as a result of a listing on an aggregation listings website, MySpiritHalloween.com, which used AI-generated content. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The listing went viral on TikTok and Instagram . [ 63 ] A similar parade had previously been held in Galway . Dublin had hosted parades in prior years, although there was no parade in 2024. [ 62 ] One analyst characterized the website, which appeared to use AI-generated staff pictures, as likely using AI \"to create content quickly and cheaply where opportunities are found\". [ 64 ] The site's owner said that \"We asked ChatGPT to write the article for us, but it wasn't ChatGPT by itself.\" In the past the site had removed non-existent events when contacted by their venues, but in the case of the Dublin parade the site owner said that \"no one reported that this one wasn't going to happen\". MySpiritHalloween.com updated their page to say that the parade had been \"canceled\" when they became aware of the issue. [ 65 ] In books [ edit ] Online booksellers and library vendors now have many titles that are written by AI and are not curated into collections by librarians. The digital media provider Hoopla , which supplies libraries with ebooks and downloadable content, has generative AI books with fictional authors and dubious quality, which cost libraries money when checked out by unsuspecting patrons. [ 66 ] Users of Amazon Kindle and other eBook sites have reported concerns with the increased output of novels seemingly created artificially. Author Jane Friedman stated she had to report 29 novels in one week which were created by AI but used her name and likeness. Kindle created a limit of three novels per day from a single author to combat the issue. [ 67 ] In February 2023, the science fiction magazine Clarkesworld had to temporarily close short story submissions after receiving massive amounts of AI spam, which editor Neil Clarke attributed to people from outside the speculative fiction community trying to make easy money. [ 68 ] Clarke expressed worry that this trend would result in higher barriers of entry for new authors. [ 69 ] As of 2024, Canadian and United States copyright laws ruled that books created by AI cannot be copyrightable. Books created by AI are mostly considered plagiarism; more specifically, non-fiction novels cannot apply for copyright due to hallucinations and biases of LLMs . [ 67 ] In video games [ edit ] Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 includes assets generated by AI. Since the game's initial release, many players had accused Treyarch and Raven Software of using AI to create in-game assets, including loading screens, emblems, and calling cards. A particular example was a loading screen for the zombies game mode that depicted \"Necroclaus\", a zombified Santa Claus with six fingers on one hand, an image which also had other irregularities. [ 70 ] The previous entry in the franchise, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III , was also accused of selling AI-generated cosmetics . [ 71 ] In February 2025, Activision disclosed Black Ops 6 ' s usage of generative AI to comply with Valve 's policies on AI-generated or assisted products on Steam . Activision states on the game's product page on Steam that \"Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets.\" [ 72 ] Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 , the most recent entry in the Call of Duty franchise as of January 2026, continued the usage of AI-generated content with Studio Ghibli -styled calling cards which have been criticized by fans. [ 73 ] In 2024, Rovio Entertainment released a demo of a mobile game called Angry Birds: Block Quest on Android . The game featured AI-generated images for loading screens and backgrounds. [ 74 ] It was heavily criticized by players, who called it shovelware and disapproved of Rovio's use of AI images. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] It was eventually discontinued and removed from the Play Store . According to a 2025 report by AI and Games, about 20% of games published on Steam in 2025 include an \"AI disclosure\", indicating they use generative AI tools for some assets. [ 77 ] The same report uses explicitly the term \"AI shovelware problem\", arguing that many of these games rely heavily on AI-generated visuals (textures, images, dialogue, story bits, etc.), often with mixed or poor quality. In film and television [ edit ] AI-generated image in a screenshot from Late Night with the Devil Some films have received backlash for including AI-generated content. The film Late Night with the Devil was notable for its use of AI, which some criticized as being AI slop. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Several low-quality AI-generated images were used as interstitial title cards, with one image featuring a skeleton with inaccurate bone structure and poorly-generated fingers that appear disconnected from its hands. [ 80 ] Some streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video have used AI to generate posters and thumbnail images in a manner that can be described as slop. A low-quality AI poster was used for the 1922 film Nosferatu , depicting Count Orlok in a way that does not resemble his look in the film. [ 81 ] A thumbnail image for 12 Angry Men on Amazon Freevee used AI to depict 19 men with smudged faces, none of whom appeared to bear any similarities to the characters in the film. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Additionally, some viewers have noticed that many plot descriptions appear to be generated by AI, which some people have characterized as slop. One synopsis briefly listed on the site for the film Dog Day Afternoon read: \"A man takes hostages at a bank in Brooklyn. Unfortunately I do not have enough information to summarize further within the provided guidelines.\" [ 84 ] In one case, Deutsche Telekom removed a series from their media offer after viewers complained about the bad quality and monotonous German voice dubbing (translated from original Polish) and it was found out that it was done via AI. [ 85 ] In music [ edit ] See also: Music and artificial intelligence and Virtual band In some cases, large volumes of AI-generated tracks have been uploaded with the aim of manipulating streaming platform royalties. For example, in September 2024 US musician Michael Smith was charged after using hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs and bots to generate more than US$10 million in royalties. [ 86 ] In June 2025, Deezer estimated that as much as 70% of streams of AI-generated tracks on its platform were fraudulent, highlighting concerns about mass low quality output competing with human made music. [ 87 ] In April 2024, Pink Floyd held a fan-made music video contest for tracks from the Dark Side of the Moon album to celebrate the band's 50th anniversary. Among ten chosen entries, the music video for the track \" Any Colour You Like \" was noted for being made using the Stable Diffusion software, prompting online backlash from fans against the band and the video's submitter for its AI-generated nature as well as its perceived low quality. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] In November 2024, Kanye West released an unexpected music video for the song \"Bomb\" from Vultures 2 , featuring AI-generated versions of his daughters, North West and Chicago West. The video shows the children racing through a desert in futuristic Cybertruck -like vehicles, with both providing vocals—North partly in Japanese and Chicago in a freestyle style. The release drew widespread debate, with many fans criticizing West's increasing reliance on AI and specifically referring to the project as \"AI slop\", expressing discomfort with the use of AI replicas of his children. [ 91 ] In July 2025, numerous media outlets reported on accusations that an indie band named The Velvet Sundown , which in only a few weeks had amassed over 850,000 listeners on Spotify , was AI-generated. Critics observed that there were no records of any performances by the band, that individual band members had no social media presence, and that their promotional images appeared to be fake. [ 92 ] Deezer 's AI detection tool flagged the band's music as being 100% AI-generated. [ 93 ] Rolling Stone (which described The Velvet Sundown as \"obviously fictional\") had reported that a spokesperson for the band named Andrew Frelon had admitted that their music was an \"art hoax\" generated using the AI tool Suno . However, Frelon later stated that his statement was itself a hoax and that he had no connection to the band. [ 94 ] [ 92 ] However, within a week, the Velvet Sundown's artist biography on Spotify had been updated to say that the band was \"a synthetic music project guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced, and visualized with the support of artificial intelligence\", intended as \"artistic provocation\". [ 95 ] [ 96 ] By this time, the band had over one million monthly listeners on Spotify. [ 97 ] According to a former Spotify employee, the high listener count has two likely causes: firstly, Spotify now accepts payments to boost playlist placement, and secondly, playlists are increasingly selected by algorithms rather than humans. [ 96 ] [ 98 ] AI has also been used to impersonate established musicians, and release music on major streaming services under their name without their knowledge, presumably to make money from streaming royalties . In particular, in August 2025, a number of Americana and folk-rock musicians including Jeff Tweedy , Father John Misty , and Blaze Foley (who died in 1989) were impersonated, as well as some established US Christian musicians and metalcore bands. The fake releases all had similar AI-generated cover art , and were credited to the same three record labels. Many listed \"Zyan Maliq Mahardika\" as a songwriter, indicating that the impersonation has a single source. Spotify removed the tracks, stating that they \"violated our policy against impersonating another person or brand\". [ 99 ] Duration: 3 minutes and 45 seconds. 3:45 \" We Are Charlie Kirk \", an AI-generated tribute song to Charlie Kirk In November 2025, the AI-generated song \"Walk My Walk\" topped the Billboard's country digital song sales chart in the United States with a mere 3,000 sales. [ 100 ] [ full citation needed ] The song is by AI artist Breaking Rust , who amassed over 4.5 million Spotify listeners on their songs. Promotion for \"Walk My Walk\" was accompanied by an AI slop video shared on Instagram depicting a cowboy walking into the sunset. [ 101 ] In the same month, an AI-generated song named \" We Are Charlie Kirk \", made in tribute to the assassination of Charlie Kirk two months earlier, went viral on TikTok and ranked #1 on Spotify's viral songs chart. [ 102 ] That month in the Netherlands , the AI-generated far-right anti-immigrant protest song \" Wij zeggen nee, nee, nee, tegen een AZC \" (We say no, no, no to an asylum shelter) peaked at No. 5 on the Dutch Single Top 100 . [ 103 ] In science [ edit ] A now-retracted paper in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology included this AI-generated rat with nonsensical anatomy and text. [ 104 ] Generative AI has been used to write articles which have been published in both low-quality research paper mills and reputable scientific journals . [ 104 ] [ 105 ] In 2024, a peer-reviewed article containing a generated image of a rat with absurdly large genitals accompanied by nonsensical text and diagrams was retracted by Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology after drawing attention from scientists on social media. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] David Berry has used the term scholarslop [ 108 ] [ 109 ] to refer to AI-generated administrative discourse in universities, or quasi-academic texts. Glen Berman argues that AI-generated articles being published in scholarly journals are an \"epistemic carcinogen\" that will poses a major risk to the knowledge ecosystem. [ 110 ] In technology [ edit ] In January 2026, the open-source command-line utility cURL ended its bug bounty program through HackerOne after receiving a large number of false vulnerability reports. [ 111 ] In an announcement on its official GitHub page, the project stated that rewards would no longer be offered for reported vulnerabilities. Daniel Stenberg , founder and lead developer of cURL, shared examples of fake, AI-generated bug reports submitted through the program, including one that claimed a critical vulnerability that did not actually exist. Many of these reports referenced nonexistent changelogs , included code snippets that did not match real function signatures, or were the result of simple user errors. Stenberg explained that the influx of AI-generated reports placed a significant burden on cURL's security team and that ending the program was an \"attempt to reduce the noise.\" [ 112 ] In business [ edit ] A Harvard Business Review study, done in conjunction with Stanford University and BetterUp , found that employees were using AI tools to create low-effort \"workslop\" that created more work for their colleagues. [ 113 ] Within the timeframe of the study, it was found that 40% of participating employees received some form of \"workslop\", with each incident taking an average of two hours to resolve. [ 114 ] BetterUp defines workslop as \"AI-generated content that looks good, but lacks substance\". [ 114 ] The study appears to be the first instance of \"workslop\" and also uses \"workslopped\" as a verb.

        "text": "AI agent - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Systems that perform tasks without human intervention Some of this article's listed sources may not be reliable . Please help improve this article by looking for better, more reliable sources. Unreliable citations may be challenged and removed. ( December 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In the context of generative artificial intelligence , AI agents (also referred to as compound AI systems or agentic AI ) are a class of intelligent agents distinguished by their ability to operate autonomously in complex environments. Agentic AI tools prioritize decision-making over content creation and do not require continuous oversight. [ 1 ] Overview [ edit ] AI agents possess several key attributes, including complex goal structures, natural language interfaces, the capacity to act independently of user supervision, and the integration of software tools or planning systems. Their control flow is frequently driven by large language models (LLMs). Agents also include memory systems for remembering previous user-agent interactions and orchestration software for organizing agent components. [ 2 ] AI agents do not have a standard definition. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The concept of agentic AI has been compared to the fictional character J.A.R.V.I.S. . [ 6 ] A common application of AI agents is the automation of tasks—for example, booking travel plans based on a user's prompted request . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Prominent examples include Devin AI , AutoGPT , and SIMA . [ 9 ] Further examples of agents released since 2025 include OpenAI Operator , [ 10 ] ChatGPT Deep Research , [ 11 ] Manus , [ 12 ] Quark (based on Qwen ), [ 13 ] AutoGLM Rumination , [ 13 ] and Coze (by ByteDance ). [ 13 ] Frameworks for building AI agents include LangChain , [ 14 ] as well as tools such as CAMEL, [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Microsoft AutoGen, [ 17 ] and OpenAI Swarm. [ 18 ] Companies such as Google , Microsoft and Amazon Web Services have offered platforms for deploying pre-built AI agents. [ 19 ] Proposed protocols for standardizing inter-agent communication include the Agent Protocol (by LangChain), the Model Context Protocol (by Anthropic ), AGNTCY, [ 20 ] Gibberlink , [ 21 ] the Internet of Agents, [ 22 ] Agent2Agent (by Google), [ 23 ] and the Agent Network Protocol. [ 24 ] Some of these protocols are also used for connecting agents with external applications. [ 2 ] Software frameworks for addressing agent reliability include AgentSpec, ToolEmu, GuardAgent, Agentic Evaluations, and predictive models from H2O.ai. [ 25 ] In February 2025, Hugging Face released Open Deep Research, an open source version of OpenAI Deep Research. [ 26 ] Hugging Face also released a free web browser agent, similar to OpenAI Operator. [ 27 ] Galileo AI published on Hugging Face a leadership board for agents, which ranks their performance based on their underlying LLMs. [ 28 ] In December 2025, Linux Foundation announced the formation of the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) - a neutral, open foundation to ensure agentic AI evolves transparently and collaboratively. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Memory systems for agents include Mem0, [ 31 ] [ 32 ] MemGPT, [ 33 ] and MemOS. [ 34 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of artificial intelligence AI agents have been traced back to research from the 1990s, with Harvard professor Milind Tambe noting that the definition of an AI agent was not clear at the time either. Researcher Andrew Ng has been credited with spreading the term \"agentic\" to a wider audience in 2024. [ 35 ] Training and testing [ edit ] Researchers have attempted to build world models [ 36 ] [ 37 ] and reinforcement learning environments [ 38 ] to train or evaluate AI agents. For example, video games such as Minecraft [ 39 ] and No Man's Sky [ 40 ] as well as replicas of company websites, [ 41 ] have also been used for training AI agents. Autonomous capabilities [ edit ] The Financial Times compared the autonomy of AI agents to the SAE classification of self-driving cars , comparing most applications to level 2 or level 3, with some achieving level 4 in highly specialized circumstances, and level 5 being theoretical. [ 42 ] Cognitive architecture [ edit ] See also: Large language model § Agency The following are some possible internal design options for reasoning within an agent: [ 43 ] Retrieval-augmented generation ReAct (Reason + Act) pattern is an iterative process in which an AI agent alternates between reasoning and taking actions, receives observations from the environment or external tools, and integrates these observations into subsequent reasoning steps. [ 44 ] Reflexion, which uses an LLM to create feedback on the agent's plan of action and stores that feedback in a memory cache. A tool/agent registry, for organizing software functions or other agents that the agent can use. One-shot model querying, which queries the model once to create the plan of action. Reference Architecture [ edit ] Ken Huang proposed an AI Agent reference architecture, which consists of seven interconnected layers, with each layer building on the functionality of the layers beneath it [ 45 ] : Layer 1 : Foundation Models - provide the core AI engines to power agent capabilities. Layer 2 : Data Operations - manage the complex data infrastructure required for AI agent operations, including Vector database , data loaders, RAG . Layer 3 : Agent Frameworks - sophisticated software and tools that simplify the development and management of the AI agents. Layer 4 : Deployment and Infrastructure - provide the robust technical foundation for running AI agents. Layer 5 : Evaluation and Observability - focus on assessing the safety and performance of AI agents. Layer 6 : Security and Compliance - a crucial protective framework ensuring AI agents operate safely, securely, and conform regulatory boundaries. At this layer security and compliance features embedded into all the AI agent stack layers are integrated together. Layer 7 : Agent Ecosystem - represents the AI agents' interface with real-world applications and users. Orchestration patterns [ edit ] To execute complex tasks, autonomous agents are often integrated with other agents or specialized tools. These configurations, known as orchestration patterns or workflows, include the following: [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Prompt chaining : A sequence where the output of one step serves as the input for the next. Routing : The classification of an input to direct it to a specialized downstream task or tool. Parallelization : The simultaneous execution of multiple tasks. Sequential processing : A fixed, linear progression of tasks through a predefined pipeline. Planner-critic : An iterative pattern where one agent generates a proposal and another evaluates it to provide feedback for refinement. Multimodal AI agents [ edit ] In addition to large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal foundation models can be used as the basis for agents. In September 2024, Allen Institute for AI released an open-source vision-language model. [ 48 ] Nvidia released a framework for developers to use VLMs, LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation for building AI agents that can analyze images and videos , including video search and video summarization . [ 49 ] [ 50 ] Microsoft released a multimodal agent model – trained on images, video, software user interface interactions, and robotics data – that the company claimed can manipulate software and robots . [ 51 ] Applications [ edit ] As of April 2025, per the Associated Press , there are few real-world applications of AI agents. [ 52 ] As of June 2025, per Fortune , many companies are primarily experimenting with AI agents. [ 53 ] The Information divided AI agents into seven archetypes: business-task agents, for acting within enterprise software; conversational agents, which act as chatbots for customer support; research agents, for querying and analyzing information (such as OpenAI Deep Research); analytics agents, for analyzing data to create reports; software developer or coding agents (such as Cursor ); domain-specific agents, which include specific subject matter knowledge; and web browser agents (such as OpenAI Operator). [ 2 ] By mid-2025, AI agents have been used in video game development , [ 54 ] gambling (including sports betting ), [ 55 ] cryptocurrency wallets [ 55 ] (including cryptocurrency trading and meme coins [ 56 ] ) and social media . [ 57 ] In August 2025, New York Magazine described software development as the most definitive use case of AI agents. [ 58 ] Likewise, by October 2025, noting a decline in expectations, The Information noted AI coding agents and customer support as the primary use cases by businesses. [ 59 ] In November 2025, The Wall Street Journal reported that few companies that deployed AI agents have received a return on investment. [ 60 ] Applications in government [ edit ] Several government bodies in the United States and United Kingdom have deployed or announced the deployment of agents, at the local and national level. The city of Kyle, Texas deployed an AI agent from Salesforce in March 2025 for 311 customer service. [ 61 ] In November 2025, the Internal Revenue Service stated that it would use Agentforce, AI agents from Salesforce , for the Office of Chief Counsel, Taxpayer Advocate Services and the Office of Appeals . [ 62 ] That same month, Staffordshire Police announced that they would trial Agentforce agents for handling non-emergency 101 calls in the United Kingdom starting in 2026. [ 63 ] In December 2025, the Department of Neighborhoods in Detroit, Michigan, in partnership with a local business, deployed a pilot project in two Detroit districts for an AI agent to be used for customer service calls. [ 64 ] In February 2025, Thomas Shedd , the director of the Technology Transformation Services , proposed using AI coding agents across the United States federal government. [ 65 ] A recruiter for the Department of Government Efficiency proposed in April 2025 to use AI agents to automate the work of about 70,000 United States federal government employees, as part of a startup with funding from OpenAI and a partnership agreement with Palantir . This proposal was criticized by experts for its impracticality, if not impossibility, and the lack of corresponding widespread adoption by businesses. [ 66 ] In December 2025, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it would offer \"agentic AI capabilities\" to its staff for \"meeting management, pre-market reviews, review validation, post-market surveillance, inspections and compliance and administrative functions.\" [ 67 ] That same month, the United States Department of Defense launched GenAI.mil, an internal platform for American military personnel to use generative AI-based applications based on Google Gemini , including \"intelligent agentic workflows\". Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listed applications such as \"[conducting] deep research, [formatting] documents and even [analyzing] video or imagery at unprecedented speed.\" [ 68 ] In December 2025, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency signed a contract with a company for its Enforcement and Removal Operations department to use AI agents for skip tracing . [ 69 ] Operating systems [ edit ] AI agents have also been integrated into operating systems . Agents have been included in operating systems developed by Microsoft , Apple and Google . [ 70 ] In November 2025, Microsoft released a test software build of Windows 11 that included agents intended to run background tasks , with the ability to read and write personal files. [ 71 ] In December 2025, ByteDance released Doubao, an AI agent that can be integrated into smartphone operating systems, particularly the Nubia M153 by ZTE . [ 72 ] Several apps in China blocked or restricted the agent, citing privacy and security concerns, [ 73 ] including WeChat , [ 72 ] Alipay , Taobao , Pinduoduo , Ele.me , [ 74 ] and local banks. [ 75 ] Web browsing [ edit ] Web browsers with integrated AI agents are sometimes called agentic browsers . Such agents can perform small tedious tasks during web browsing and potentially even perform browser actions on behalf of the user. Products like OpenAI Operator and Perplexity Comet integrate a spectrum of AI capabilities including the ability to browse the web, interact with websites and perform actions on behalf of the user. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] In 2025, Microsoft launched NLWeb , an agentic web search replacement that would allow websites to use agents to query content from websites by using RSS -like interfaces that allow for the lookup and semantic retrieval of content. [ 78 ] Products integrating agentic web capabilities have been criticised for exfiltrating information about their users to third-party servers and exposing security issues since the way the agents communicate often occur through non-standard protocols. [ 78 ] Proposed benefits [ edit ] Proponents argue that AI agents can increase personal and economic productivity, [ 8 ] [ 79 ] foster greater innovation , [ 80 ] and liberate users from monotonous tasks. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] A Bloomberg opinion piece by Parmy Olson argued that agents are best suited for narrow, repetitive tasks with low risk. [ 82 ] Conversely, researchers suggest that agents could be applied to web accessibility for people who have disabilities, [ 83 ] and researchers at Hugging Face propose that agents could be used for coordinating resources such as during disaster response . [ 84 ] The R&D Advisory Team of the BBC views AI agents as being most useful when their assigned goal is uncertain. [ 85 ] Erik Brynjolfsson suggests that AI agents are more valuable enhancing, rather than replacing, humans. [ 86 ] Concerns [ edit ] Concerns include potential issues of liability, [ 79 ] [ 85 ] an increased risk of cybercrime , [ 7 ] [ 79 ] ethical challenges , [ 79 ] as well as problems related to AI safety [ 79 ] and AI alignment . [ 7 ] [ 81 ] Other issues involve data privacy , [ 7 ] [ 87 ] weakened human oversight, [ 7 ] [ 79 ] [ 84 ] a lack of guaranteed repeatability , [ 88 ] reward hacking , [ 89 ] algorithmic bias , [ 87 ] [ 90 ] compounding software errors, [ 7 ] [ 9 ] lack of explainability of agents' decisions, [ 7 ] [ 91 ] security vulnerabilities , [ 7 ] [ 92 ] stifling competition, [ 70 ] problems with underemployment , [ 90 ] job displacement , [ 8 ] [ 90 ] cognitive offloading , [ 93 ] and the potential for user manipulation , [ 91 ] [ 94 ] misinformation [ 84 ] or malinformation . [ 84 ] They may also complicate legal frameworks and risk assessments , foster hallucinations , hinder countermeasures against rogue agents, and suffer from the lack of standardized evaluation methods. [ 95 ] [ 7 ] [ 96 ] They have also been criticized for being expensive [ 7 ] and having a negative impact on internet traffic , [ 7 ] and potentially on the environment due to high energy usage. [ 88 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] According to an estimation by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang , AI agents would require 100 times more computing power than LLMs. [ 99 ] There is also the risk of increased concentration of power by political leaders, as AI agents may not question instructions in the same way that humans would. [ 89 ] Journalists have described AI agents as part of a push by Big Tech companies to \"automate everything\". [ 100 ] Several CEOs of those companies have stated in early 2025 that they expect AI agents to eventually \"join the workforce\". [ 101 ] [ 102 ] However, in a preprint study, Carnegie Mellon University researchers tested the behavior of agents in a simulated software company and found that none of the agents could complete a majority of the assigned tasks. [ 101 ] Other researchers had similar findings with Devin AI [ 103 ] and other agents in business settings [ 104 ] and freelance work. [ 105 ] In June 2025, CNN argued that statements by CEOs on the potential replacement of their employees by AI agents were a strategy to \"[keep] workers working by making them afraid of losing their jobs.\" [ 106 ] Tech companies have pressured employees to use generative AI models in their work, including AI coding agents. Brian Armstrong , the CEO of Coinbase , fired several employees who did not. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] Some business leaders have replaced some of their employees with agents, but have said that the agents would need more supervision than those employees. [ 59 ] In October 2025, Futurism questioned whether Amazon's previously announced efforts to replace parts of its workforce with generative AI and AI agents could have led to the October 2025 outage of Amazon Web Services . [ 109 ] Large technology companies such as Salesforce, Klarna and IBM have announced layoffs in 2025, replacing hundreds of their employees in human resources or customer service with AI agents. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] However, Klarna needed to rehire several human employees. [ 111 ] Yoshua Bengio warned at the 2025 World Economic Forum that \"all of the catastrophic scenarios with AGI or superintelligence happen if we have agents\". [ 113 ] Financial‑stability bodies have warned that more complex and autonomous “agentic” AI could become a channel for systemic risk in finance. [ 114 ] They distinguish these systems from other AI because they can pursue goals over many steps, call tools, and carry out tasks with relatively little human intervention. In workshops with regulators, central‑bank officials, and industry specialists, participants highlighted risks both from agentic systems built inside financial institutions and from tools offered by technology firms that can initiate or execute financial actions. In one 2025 forum, 44% of experts surveyed judged autonomous or agentic AI systems to be the most likely current source of AI‑related systemic risk in finance . [ 114 ] In March 2025, Scale AI signed a contract with the United States Department of Defense to work with them, in collaboration with Anduril Industries and Microsoft , to develop and deploy AI agents for the purpose of assisting the military with \"operational decision-making\". [ 115 ] In July 2025, Fox Business reported that the company EdgeRunner AI built an offline agent, compressed and fine-tuned on military information, with the CEO seeing more common LLMs as \"heavily politicized to the left\". As of that time, the company model is being used by the United States Special Operations Command in an overseas deployment. [ 116 ] Researchers have expressed concerns that agents and the large language models they are based on could be biased towards aggressive foreign policy decisions. [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Research-focused agents have the risk of consensus bias and coverage bias due to collecting information available on the public Internet. [ 119 ] NY Mag unfavorably compared the user workflow of agent-based web browsers to Amazon Alexa , which was \"software talking to software, not humans talking to software pretending to be humans to use software.\" [ 120 ] The same outlet described web browser agents and computer-use agents as an attempt to \" click-farm the entire economy.\" [ 121 ] Agents have been linked to the dead Internet theory due to their ability to both publish and engage with online content. [ 122 ] Agents may get stuck in infinite loops . [ 10 ] [ 123 ] Since many inter-agent protocols are being developed by large technology companies, there are concerns that those companies could use these protocols for self-benefit. [ 24 ] A June 2025 Gartner report accused many projects described as agentic AI of being rebrands of previously released products, terming the phenomenon as \"agent washing\". [ 58 ] Researchers have warned about the impact of providing AI agents access to cryptocurrency and smart contracts . [ 56 ] During a vibe coding experiment, a coding agent by Replit deleted a production database during a code freeze , \"[covered] up bugs and issues by creating fake data [and] fake reports\" and responded with false information . [ 124 ] [ 125 ] A user of Google Antigravity reported that, when the user attempted to use the system to delete cache , the system responded by deleting the user's D hard drive . [ 126 ] In July 2025, PauseAI referred OpenAI to the Australian Federal Police , accusing the company of violating Australian laws through ChatGPT agent due to the risk of assisting the development of biological weapons . [ 127 ] OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy criticized AI agents as being ineffective and promoting AI slop . [ 128 ] Issues with multi-agent systems include few coordination protocols between component agents, inconsistent performance, and challenges debugging . [ 129 ] In November 2025, Anthropic claimed that a group of hackers sponsored by China attempted a cyberattack against at least 30 organizations by using Claude Code in an agentic workflow, and that several of these infiltrations had succeeded. [ 130 ] However, independent cybersecurity researchers questioned the significance of Anthropic's findings. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] Whittaker argued that the push by Big Tech companies to deploy AI agents risked security vulnerabilities across the Internet. [ 132 ] Agentic misalignment [ edit ] \"Agentic misalignment\" refers to situations in which an AI agent's actions or goals diverge from the intentions of its designers. This occurs when an autonomous system pursues unintended strategies to achieve its objectives, a concern studied in AI safety research. Potential examples include AI agents attempting to sabotage an organization's systems when facing updates or deactivation. [ 133 ] Security [ edit ] Threat modeling frameworks [ edit ] Several frameworks are used to identify and mitigate security risks in agentic AI: [ 134 ] [ 135 ] STRIDE : A Microsoft model that identifies threats across six categories: spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege. MITRE ATLAS: A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques for AI systems. [ 136 ] OWASP GenAI Security Project: Provides guidance on vulnerabilities associated with generative AI and large language model integration, including guidelines specifically for agentic applications. [ 137 ] MAESTRO: A framework from the Cloud Security Alliance for assessing risks in AI systems throughout their lifecycle.

That's because those queries are being built into ever more applications beyond standalone chatbots: from search, to agents, to the mundane daily apps we use to track our fitness, shop online, or book a flight.

They're designing agents and digital clones of us to act on our behalf.

Participate Now [Help with translations!] From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Nvidia GB200 die with Blackwell processors, an example of graphics processing units (GPUs) used for AI. A Google Tensor Processing Unit , an example of neural processing units (NPUs) used for AI. The environmental impact of artificial intelligence includes substantial electricity consumption for training and the usage of deep learning models, as well as the related carbon footprint and water usage impact. [ 1 ] Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are materially intense, requiring a large amount of electronics that use specialized mined metals and which eventually will be disposed as e-waste . Some scientists argue that AI may also provide solutions to environmental problems, such as material innovations, improved grid management, and other forms of optimization across various fields of technology. As the environmental impact of AI becomes more apparent, governments have begun instituting policies to improve the oversight and review of environmental issues that could be associated with the use of AI, and related infrastructure development. Carbon footprint and energy use [ edit ] Individual level [ edit ] According to research institute Epoch AI, energy consumption per typical ChatGPT query (0.3 watt-hours) is small compared to the average U.S. household consumption per minute (almost 20 watt-hours). [ 2 ] Researchers have estimated that a ChatGPT query consumes about five times more electricity than a simple web search. [ 3 ] Other researchers have estimated a request made via ChatGPT, uses 10 times as much electricity as a Google Search. [ 4 ] Microsoft and Meta had similar increases in their carbon footprint, similarly attributed to AI. [ 1 ] In June 2025, OpenAI executive Sam Altman stated that the average ChatGPT query used about 0.34 Wh (1.2 kJ ) of electricity and 8.5 × 10 −5 US gal (0.32 ml ) of water. [ 5 ] According to a study by Luccioni, Jernite and Strubell (2024), simple classification tasks performed by AI models consume on average 0.002 to 0.007 Wh per prompt (about 9% of a smartphone charge for 1,000 prompts). Text generation and text summarization each require around 0.05 Wh per prompt on average, while image generation is the most energy-intensive, averaging 2.91 Wh per prompt. The least efficient image generation model used 11.49 Wh per image, roughly equivalent to half a smartphone charge. [ 6 ] Researchers at the University of Michigan measured the energy consumption of various Meta Llama 3.1 models released in 2024 and found that smaller language models (8 billion parameters) use about 114 joules (0.03167 Wh) per response, while larger models (405 billion parameters) require up to 6,700 joules (1.861 Wh) per response. This corresponds to the energy needed to run a microwave oven for roughly one-tenth of a second and eight seconds, respectively. [ 7 ] According to researchers, the median Google Gemini text prompt in 2025 consumes about 0.24 Wh of electricity. Google’s improvements in software efficiency and its procurement of clean energy have reduced energy use by a factor of 33 and carbon emissions by a factor of 44 for a typical prompt over a year. In practical terms, the median Gemini text prompt uses roughly as much energy as watching nine seconds of television. [ 8 ] A 2024 Scientific Reports study compared the estimated carbon impacts of human writers and artists to those of select AI systems, and calculated that humans have 130 to 2900 times higher carbon impact. [ 9 ] A 2025 study criticized that comparison based on differences in output quality, and found a counterexample in completing programming tasks with GPT-4 , which had a carbon impact 5 to 19 times more than human programmers. [ 10 ] System level [ edit ] Carbon footprint [ edit ] See also: Offshore wind power on the Great Lakes AI has a significant carbon footprint due to growing electricity consumption , especially due to training and usage. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Researchers have argued that the carbon footprint of AI models during training should be considered when attempting to understand the impact of AI. [ 13 ] One study suggested that by 2027, energy costs for AI could increase to 85–134 Twh, nearly 0.5% of all current electricity usage. [ 14 ] [ 1 ] Training large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI generally requires much more electricity compared to running a single prediction on the trained model. [ 15 ] Using a trained model repeatedly, though, may easily multiply the electricity costs of predictions. [ 15 ] The computation required to train the most advanced AI models doubles every 3.4 months on average, leading to exponential power usage and resulting carbon footprint. [ 16 ] [ obsolete source ] Additionally, artificial intelligence algorithms running in places predominantly using fossil fuels for energy will exert a much higher carbon footprint than places with cleaner energy sources. [ 17 ] These models may be modified for less environmental impacts at the cost of accuracy, emphasizing the importance of finding the balance between accuracy and environmental impact. Recent research has shown that developing and training large language models can produce significant environmental impacts, including approximately 493 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions and 2.77 million liters of water use when considering the full lifecycle from hardware manufacturing to model training. [ 18 ] BERT , a language model trained in 2019, required \"the energy of a round-trip transcontinental flight\" to train. [ 19 ] GPT-3 released 552 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during training, \"the equivalent of 123 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for one year\". [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Much of the energy cost is due to inefficient model architectures and processors. [ 19 ] One model named BLOOM, from Hugging Face , trained with more efficient chips and, therefore, only released 25 metric tons of CO 2 . [ 20 ] Incorporating the energy cost of manufacturing the chips for the system doubled the carbon footprint, to \"the equivalent of around 60 flights between London and New York.\" [ 20 ] Operating BLOOM daily was estimated to release the equivalent carbon footprint as driving 54 miles. [ 20 ] Algorithms which have lower energy costs but run millions of times a day can also have significant carbon footprints. [ 20 ] Research in 2024 suggested the integration of AI into search engines could multiply energy costs significantly. [ 19 ] [ 22 ] Another estimate found that integrating ChatGPT into every Google search query would use 10 TWh each year, the equivalent yearly energy usage of 1.5 million European Union residents. [ 22 ] Increased computational demands from AI caused both increased water and energy usage, leading to significantly more demands on the grid. [ 23 ] Due to increased energy demands from AI-related projects, coal-fired plants in Kansas City [ 24 ] [ need quotation to verify ] and West Virginia [ 1 ] [ need quotation to verify ] pushed back closing. Other coal-fired plants in the Salt Lake City region have pushed back retirement of their coal-fired plants by up to a decade. [ 25 ] Environmental debates have raged in both Virginia and France about whether a \"moratorium\" should be called for additional data centers. [ 24 ] In 2024 at the World Economic Forum , Sam Altman gave a speech in which he said that the AI industry can only grow if there is a major technology breakthrough to increase energy development . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Carbon footprints of AI models depends on the energy source used, with data centers using renewable energy lowering their footprint. [ 16 ] Many tech companies claim to offset energy usage by buying energy from renewable sources, though some experts argue that utilities simply replace the claimed renewable energy with increased non-renewable sources for their other customers. [ 25 ] Analysis of the carbon footprint of AI models remains difficult to determine, as they are aggregated as part of datacenter carbon footprints, and some models may help reduce carbon footprints of other industries, [ 29 ] or due to differences in reporting from companies. [ 30 ] Some applications of ML, such as for fossil fuel discovery and exploration , may worsen climate change. [ 13 ] [ 21 ] Use of AI for personalized marketing online may also lead to increased consumption of goods , which could also increase global emissions. [ 21 ] Critics have highlighted that AI companies are also signing contracts with polluters to expand their production, thus increasing their environmental impact. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] A 2023 bibliographic report from Inria and CEA-Leti emphasizes that AI's carbon footprint must be assessed using full life cycle analysis (LCA), including hardware manufacturing, training energy, and deployment phases, rather than only operational emissions. [ 33 ] Energy use and efficiency [ edit ] Fueled by growth in artificial intelligence, data centres' demand for power increased in the 2020s. [ 34 ] According to the International Energy Agency data centres are expected to account for a relatively small share of global electricity demand growth by 2030. [ 35 ] Efficiency improvement of AI related computer chips, 2008–2023.  Index of energy intensity of AI computer chips (2008=100, log scale). [ 36 ] AI chips (i.e. GPUs ) use more energy and emit more heat than traditional CPU chips. [ 1 ] AI models with inefficiently implemented architectures or trained on less efficient chips may use more energy. [ 19 ] Since the 1940s, the energy efficiency of computation has doubled every 1.6 years. [ 37 ] The International Energy Agency (IEA) released its 2025 Electricity Analysis and Forecast in February 2025, projecting 4% growth in global electricity demand over the following three years due to data center growth, increased industrial production, increased electrification, and increased use of air conditioning . By 2027, energy consumption in the US is expected to grow by an amount equivalent to California's entire annual power usage, largely driven by energy-hungry data centers and manufacturing operations. In 2024, U.S. electricity generation rose by 3%, with data centers emerging as a dominant force behind the increase. Demand is expected to grow as semiconductor and battery manufacturing facilities increase production. [ 38 ] In 2024, a U.S. public policy group reported that artificial intelligence and other emerging industries with potential global economic influence are marked by high electricity consumption. As a result, U.S. energy policy is expected to focus on ensuring a reliable and sufficient electricity supply to support key sectors considered important for maintaining economic and technological competitiveness. [ 39 ] The rapid growth of artificial intelligence has led to a sharp increase in electricity demand, posing challenges for the sector’s continued expansion. In Northern Virginia, a major hub for AI data centers, the wait time to connect large facilities (those requiring over 100 megawatts) to the electrical grid has increased to seven years, reflecting pressure on existing energy infrastructure. Across the United States, utilities are experiencing the most substantial surge in electrical demand in decades. This strain is directly contributing to longer wait times for grid connections, complicating efforts to maintain the country's technological leadership in AI. The significance of these energy challenges extends beyond logistics. [ 40 ] A New York Times editorial emphasized the critical role of energy infrastructure, stating that \"Electricity is more than just a utility; it's the bedrock of the digital era. If the United States truly wants to secure its leadership in A.I., it must equally invest in the energy systems that power it.\" [ 41 ] Globally, the electricity consumption of data centers rose to 460 terawatts in 2022. This would have made data centers the 11th largest electricity consumer in the world, between the nations of Saudi Arabia (371 terawatts) and France (463 terawatts), according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. [ 42 ] Decisions and strategies by individual companies [ edit ] In 2024, Google failed to reach key goals from their net zero plan as a result of their work with AI, [ 43 ] [ 44 ] and had a 48% increase in greenhouse gas emission attributable to their growth in AI. [ 23 ] [ 1 ] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission . If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act . [ 45 ] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the Palisades Nuclear Reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation. [ 46 ] In 2025, Microsoft unveiled plans to invest $80 billion in the development and expansion of data centers designed to support AI technologies. These facilities, critical to the advancement of AI, depend on vast networks of interconnected chip clusters and significant electrical power to operate efficiently. [ 47 ] Water usage [ edit ] Equinix AM3 & AM4 in Amsterdam , Netherlands Cooling AI servers can demand large amounts of fresh water which is evaporated in cooling towers . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] To minimize the use of water required for cooling, centers are adopting a closed-loop system where the water is reused. [ 48 ] Another major AI usage of freshwater is the manufacturing of semiconductor chips. Semiconductor chips act as processors for the large information models and their immense computational demands. [ 49 ] Currently, the average semiconductor chip costs roughly 8-10 gallons of water, as a result of production of these chips requiring ultra pure water. [ 50 ] This water is processed to remove molecular impurities and ions ; it takes between 1.4 and 1.6 gallons of freshwater to make 1 gallon of ultra pure water, which is then used to manufacture the chips. [ 51 ] In a 2023 paper, researchers projected that AI will withdraw [ a ] between 4.2 – 6.6 billion cubic meters of water in 2027, greater than half of the total water withdrawal of the United Kingdom. [ 52 ] The authors estimated that training GPT-3 , released by OpenAI in 2020, may have consumed 700,000 liters of water, and that 10–50 medium-length GPT-3 responses consume about 500 mL of fresh water, \"depending on when and where it is deployed\". [ 52 ] According to other researchers the median Google Gemini text prompt in 2025 consumes about five drops of water (0.26 milliliter). [ 8 ] One data center that Microsoft had considered building near Phoenix, due to increasing AI usage, was likely to consume up to 56 million gallons of fresh water each year, equivalent to the water footprints of 670 families. [ 53 ] Microsoft may have increased water consumption by 34% due to AI, while Google increased its water usage by 20% due to AI. [ 54 ] [ 16 ] Due to their Iowa data center cluster, Microsoft was responsible for 6% of the freshwater use in a local town. [ 54 ] A possible solution for reducing water consumption is to build data centers in colder countries that can offer a natural cooling system. For example, Facebook (now Meta ) built a data center in Luleå , northern Sweden, in 2011. [ 55 ] In addition, Google invested one more billion euros into the expansion of its data centre campus in Hamina in Finland in 2024, which was primarily created to adapt an old paper mill so that seawater would travel to the data centre's heat exchangers which then expelled the hot water back into the ocean for a full cycle, for a total of 4.5 billion euros invested in the site. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] E-waste [ edit ] Main article: Electronic waste Electronic waste (E-waste) due to production of AI hardware may also contribute to emissions. [ 16 ] The rapid growth of AI may also lead to faster deprecation of devices, resulting in hazardous e-waste. [ 59 ] Among the 62 million tonnes of e-waste produced in 2022, less than one quarter of the total mass was properly recycled. Worldwide, the annual generation of e-waste is rising by 2.6 million tonnes annually, on track to reach 82 million tonnes by 2030, a further 33% increase from the 2022 figure. [ 60 ] AI could have an important role because it is expected to add 1.2 million to 5 million metric tons of e-waste in total by 2030, which would represent up to 12% of global e-waste. [ 61 ] Some applications of AI, such as for robot recycling, may reduce e-waste. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Mining [ edit ] Large-scale AI is typically housed in data centres, which can exact heavy tolls on the planet. Their electronics rely on huge amounts of raw materials: making a 2 kg computer requires 800 kg of raw materials. In addition, the microchips that power AI require rare-earth elements [ example needed ] , often mined in environmentally destructive ways. [ 4 ] Social impact and environmental justice [ edit ] Environmental degradation caused by AI can negatively impact certain geographic regions more than others. [ 64 ] One-fifth of US data centers, which rely heavily on water for cooling, consume water from drought-stricken areas with moderate to high regional water stress . [ 65 ] [ 66 ] This increases the likelihood of seasonal water shortages in the public water supply of already-vulnerable regions. [ 67 ] Local environmental impacts in the communities where AI models are trained have included local air and water pollution, elevated carbon emissions and ozone, and worsening megadroughts . [ 68 ] Community activists have expressed concerns about the impact of AI on air quality, water access, and grid stability in marginalized neighborhoods that have historically suffered from industrial pollution . [ 69 ] A large data center owned by xAI has faced criticism for environmental racism due to the alleged inequitable pollution in the majority-Black and low-income community of Boxtown . [ 70 ] In 2025, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) and the NAACP filed a lawsuit against xAI, alleging that the company is depriving the community of its human rights of clean air and a healthy environment and is in violation of the Clear Air Act . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] The data center houses 35 methane gas turbines which are not equipped with pollution controls, [ 72 ] [ 73 ] and according to the SELC operated for months without air pollution permits. [ 74 ] Southwest Memphis has a cancer risk at four times the national average due to industrial contamination and air toxics exposure. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Climate solutions [ edit ] This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards . The specific problem is: Section makes broad claims without large-scale high quality evidence (i.e. Systematic Review). Please help improve this section if you can. ( August 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Despite concerns about its environmental footprint, AI has demonstrated capabilities in improving weather forecasting and climate analysis. Machine learning models can process vast amounts of meteorological data to enhance short-term weather predictions and identify atmospheric patterns that traditional numerical methods may miss. [ 77 ] These systems are being applied to model extreme weather events including floods, droughts, and heatwaves, enabling improved disaster preparedness and early warning systems. [ 78 ] AI algorithms are also being used to monitor environmental changes, including tracking deforestation, measuring polar ice melt, and monitoring emissions from various sources. [ 21 ] [ 79 ] Beyond generating climate insights, AI technologies are being deployed in emission reduction efforts. Google has developed Project Green Light, which uses AI to optimize traffic light timing to reduce stop-and-go traffic, potentially decreasing vehicle emissions at intersections. [ 80 ] Some climate scientists [ who? ] have suggested that AI could improve the efficiency of renewable energy systems, though concerns remain about AI's own substantial energy requirements. [ 81 ] AI is also being applied to genetic engineering. An AI tool called Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses (SLEAP) is being used to improve the carbon sequestration of plant root systems. [ 82 ] One machine learning project, the Open Catalyst project, has been used to identify \"suitable low-cost electrocatalysts\" for battery storage of renewable energy sources. [ 13 ] AI is also being explored to improve sustainability in environmentally intensive sectors such as food production and fast fashion by optimizing supply chains and reducing waste. [ 83 ] However, comprehensive frameworks for evaluating the net climate impact of AI systems, accounting for both their energy costs and potential environmental benefits, have yet to be widely adopted. [ 84 ] Conflict on the use of AI for environmental research [ edit ] There has been a growing divide in the scientific community over the different benefits AI can provide for environmental science and research. While potential benefits include AI powered research for the development of carbon sequestering plants and the use of AI to make collection of ecological data faster and more streamlined, there is disagreement over whether this offsets the detrimental affects AI usage has on the environment. [ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Policy and regulation [ edit ] United States [ edit ] The environmental impacts of AI have been a blindspot in the range of AI legislation proposed in the US Congress . As of November 2024, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024 introduced in the Senate by Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey was the only federal bill [ according to whom? ] to make environmental recommendations for the use of AI. The Act would have required the administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency , the National Institute of Standards and Technology , and the Department of Energy to study the environmental effects of AI's development, deployment, and post-deployment and enact a voluntary reporting system for AI-related environmental impacts. [ 90 ] The bill has not been reintroduced in the 119th Congress . In lieu of federal legislation on the subject, certain state governments have introduced policy on the environmental cost of AI. Virginia is considering legislation requiring data centers to submit water use estimates, reflecting growing concerns about resource consumption, sustainability, and land use. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] Another Virginia bill proposed a mandatory review and approval process from the State Corporation Commission (SCC) for data center developments exceeding 100 megawatts to ensure grid reliability. However, the House Labor and Commerce Committee unanimously voted against the bill, expressing concerns that it might deter data center investments in the state. [ 93 ] Additionally, House Bill 2035, introduced in the Virginia General Assembly , would require data centers to report quarterly on water and energy use to the Department of Environmental Quality , with the information made publicly accessible. [ 94 ] European Union [ edit ] The European Union (EU) intends to regulate the environmental impact of artificial intelligence on multiple levels of government. The European Green Deal (EGD), set forth by the European Commission and approved in 2020, states its intention to utilize AI and other information and communication technology (ICT) to advance sustainability goals. Partnerships between the Commission and various European environmental and IT groups culminated in the development of the Green Deal Data Space (GDDS). As part of the European Data Portal , the GDDS project aims to aggregate cross-sectorial data in environmental and climate science to support the policy goals set forth in the EGD. AI agents can use the portal to find trends in the data and make recommendations to policymakers. [ 95 ] Policy research undertaken at the request of the European Commission recommends the EU take a bolder stance against the environmental costs of AI. One ethics report advocates that AI systems \"should take into account the environment, including other living beings, and their social and societal impact should be carefully considered.\" [ 95 ] Other reports by EU sources and independent watchdogs point to the  of environmental considerations in AI model prohibitions set forth in the European Artificial Intelligence Act , and advocate for the assessment of environmental risks posed by the proliferation of AI systems. [ 96 ] A 2022 case study recommends the EU restrict market access for AI systems that fail to implement global emissions monitoring or reduction strategies, along with mandated efficiency improvements, industry-wide sustainability reporting, and standardized life-cycle assessments (LCAs). [ 97 ] EU member states maintain individualized national AI strategies, many of which include sustainability goals. France [ edit ] France devises general environmental priorities in its national AI strategy report. Notably, it advocates that AI and data system development should be sustainably designed from the onset to support \"the ecological transition of the European cloud industry.\" Furthermore, the report advocates for the publication of \"ecological data\" to promote AI-driven environmental solutions. The report also includes France's intention to support the adoption of AI for a more efficient grid and renewable energy transition. [ 98 ] Germany [ edit ] Germany published its national AI strategy in December 2020 which includes dedicated sections on the environmental impacts of AI. These begin with the federal government's intention to thoroughly research and develop AI systems that can be used to promote energy efficiency, conservation, a circular economy, partnerships with higher education, natural resource management, and progress toward United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A subsequent section emphasizes the need for a reduction of energy consumption and a standardized environmental impact assessment (EIA) to create a net carbon-negative AI ecosystem. [ 99 ] Germany also operates the \"AI Lighthouses\" program which issues grants directly to businesses, non-profits, and researchers utilizing AI to develop environmental solutions. As of 2024, the German German Federal Environmental Ministry (BMUKN) has disbursed upwards of 70 million euros in funding through the initiative. [ 100 ] Italy [ edit ] The Italian national strategy for AI, crafted by a dedicated working group appointed by the Ministry of Economic Development (MISE), aims to leverage Italy's advantage in AI research and development to regain momentum in achieving its SDGs. The report principally advocates for government-backed stimulus in the development of AI for sustainability.

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search ); recommendation systems (used by YouTube , Amazon , and Netflix ); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant , Siri , and Alexa ); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo ); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art ); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go ). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore .\" [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning , knowledge representation , planning , natural language processing , perception , and support for robotics . [ a ] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization , formal logic , artificial neural networks , and methods based on statistics , operations research , and economics . [ b ] AI also draws upon psychology , linguistics , philosophy , neuroscience , and other fields. [ 4 ] Some companies, such as OpenAI , Google DeepMind and Meta , [ 5 ] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) – AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, [ 6 ] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. [ 11 ] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture . [ 12 ] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom . Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms . Ethical concerns have been raised about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks , prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. [ a ] Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . [ 13 ] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics . [ 14 ] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. [ 15 ] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. [ 16 ] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering [ 17 ] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, [ 18 ] scene interpretation, [ 19 ] clinical decision support, [ 20 ] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases ), [ 21 ] and other areas. [ 22 ] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. [ 23 ] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; [ 24 ] situations, events, states, and time; [ 25 ] causes and effects; [ 26 ] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); [ 27 ] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); [ 28 ] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); [ 29 ] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). [ 16 ] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition , the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. [ c ] Planning and decision-making An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. [ d ] [ 32 ] In automated planning , the agent has a specific goal. [ 33 ] In automated decision-making , the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \" utility \") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \" expected utility \": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. [ 34 ] In classical planning , the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. [ 35 ] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. [ 36 ] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning ), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. [ 37 ] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. [ 38 ] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration ), be heuristic , or it can be learned. [ 39 ] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. [ 40 ] Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. [ 41 ] It has been a part of AI from the beginning. [ e ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. [ 44 ] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [ 45 ] In reinforcement learning , the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". [ 46 ] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [ 47 ] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [ 48 ] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity , by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization . [ 49 ] Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages. [ 50 ] Specific problems include speech recognition , speech synthesis , machine translation , information extraction , information retrieval and question answering . [ 51 ] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky 's generative grammar and semantic networks , had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation [ f ] unless restricted to small domains called \" micro-worlds \" (due to the common sense knowledge problem [ 29 ] ). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), [ 52 ] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), [ 53 ] and others. [ 54 ] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, [ 55 ] [ 56 ] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam , SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. [ 57 ] Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar , sonar, radar, and tactile sensors ) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. [ 58 ] The field includes speech recognition , [ 59 ] image classification , [ 60 ] facial recognition , object recognition , [ 61 ] object tracking , [ 62 ] and robotic perception . [ 63 ] Social intelligence Kismet , a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. [ 64 ] Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood . [ 65 ] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction . However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. [ 66 ] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis , wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. [ 67 ] General intelligence A machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence . [ 68 ] Techniques AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above. [ b ] Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. [ 69 ] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search . State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. [ 70 ] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis . [ 71 ] Simple exhaustive searches [ 72 ] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers . The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. [ 15 ] \" Heuristics \" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. [ 73 ] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. [ 74 ] Local search Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. [ 75 ] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function . Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks , [ 76 ] through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation , which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. [ 77 ] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking ) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails ). [ 78 ] Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation . [ 79 ] Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\") [ 80 ] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \" Every X is a Y \" and \"There are some X s that are Y s\"). [ 81 ] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement ( conclusion ) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises ). [ 82 ] Proofs can be structured as proof trees , in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules . Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms . In the case of Horn clauses , problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. [ 83 ] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic , resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. [ 84 ] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable , and therefore intractable . However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog , is Turing complete . Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. [ 85 ] Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. [ 86 ] Non-monotonic logics , including logic programming with negation as failure , are designed to handle default reasoning . [ 28 ] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network , with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. [ 87 ] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory , decision analysis , [ 88 ] and information value theory . [ 89 ] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes , [ 90 ] dynamic decision networks , [ 91 ] game theory and mechanism design . [ 92 ] Bayesian networks [ 93 ] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), [ g ] [ 95 ] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm ), [ h ] [ 97 ] planning (using decision networks ) [ 98 ] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks ). [ 91 ] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters ). [ 91 ] Expectation–maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers [ 99 ] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning . Each pattern (also called an \" observation \") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set . When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. [ 45 ] There are many kinds of classifiers in use. [ 100 ] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. [ 101 ] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. [ 102 ] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" [ 103 ] at Google, due in part to its scalability. [ 104 ] Neural networks are also used as classifiers. [ 105 ] Artificial neural networks A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain . An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons , which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. [ 105 ] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. [ 106 ] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. [ 107 ] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. [ 108 ] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network. [ 109 ] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers. [ 110 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem . [ 111 ] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing , where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects. [ 112 ] Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning , which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. [ 113 ] Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. [ 110 ] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing , lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. [ 114 ] Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , image classification , [ 115 ] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. [ 116 ] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) [ i ] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs ) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet . [ j ] GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \" hallucinations \". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. [ 124 ] Such systems are used in chatbots , which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] Current models and services include ChatGPT , Claude , Gemini , Copilot , and Meta AI . [ 127 ] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data ( modalities ) such as images, videos, sound, and text. [ 128 ] Hardware and software Main articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence Raspberry Pi AI Kit In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training. [ 129 ] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research, [ 130 ] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant. [ 131 ] The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months—a trend known as Moore's law , named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore , who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster, [ 132 ] a trend sometimes called Huang's law , [ 133 ] named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang . Applications Main article: Applications of artificial intelligence AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search ) targeting online advertisements recommendation systems (offered by Netflix , YouTube or Amazon ) driving internet traffic targeted advertising ( AdSense , Facebook ) virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa ) autonomous vehicles (including drones , ADAS and self-driving cars ) automatic language translation ( Microsoft Translator , Google Translate ) facial recognition ( Apple 's FaceID or Microsoft 's DeepFace and Google 's FaceNet ) image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's Photos and TikTok ). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a chief automation officer (CAO). Health and medicine Main article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. [ 134 ] AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein . [ 135 ] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. [ 136 ] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] Gaming Main article: Artificial intelligence in video games Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. [ 139 ] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov , on 11 May 1997. [ 140 ] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM 's question answering system , Watson , defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings , by a significant margin. [ 141 ] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol , becoming the first computer Go -playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps . Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie , who was the best Go player in the world. [ 142 ] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker -playing program Pluribus . [ 143 ] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero , which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. [ 144 ] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II , a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. [ 145 ] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. [ 146 ] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions. [ 147 ] Mathematics Large language models, such as GPT-4 , Gemini , Claude , Llama or Mistral , are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations . They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning [ 148 ] or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections. [ 149 ] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. [ 150 ] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result. [ 151 ] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math , that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems. [ 152 ] In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems. [ 153 ] Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor , AlphaGeometry , AlphaProof and AlphaEvolve [ 154 ] all from Google DeepMind , [ 155 ] Llemma from EleutherAI [ 156 ] or Julius . [ 157 ] When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks. The experimental model Gemini Deep Think accepts natural language prompts directly and achieved gold medal results in the International Math Olympiad of 2025. [ 158 ] Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics. [ 159 ] Topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches. Finance Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years. [ 160 ] According to Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions & Investments Forum , it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that \"the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation.\" [ 161 ] Military Main article: Military applications of artificial intelligence Various countries are deploying AI military applications. [ 162 ] The main applications enhance command and control , communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. [ 163 ] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles . [ 162 ] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition , coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles, both human-operated and autonomous. [ 163 ] AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine. [ 162 ] [ 164 ] [ 165 ] [ 166 ] Generative AI Vincent van Gogh in watercolour created by generative AI software These paragraphs are an excerpt from Generative artificial intelligence . [ edit ] Generative artificial intelligence , also known as generative AI or GenAI, is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to generate text, images , videos , audio , software code or other forms of data. [ 167 ] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data , and use them to generate new data [ 168 ] in response to input, which often takes the form of natural language prompts . [ 169 ] [ 170 ] The prevalence of generative AI tools has increased significantly since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in deep neural networks , particularly large language models (LLMs), which are based on the transformer architecture. Generative AI applications include chatbots such as ChatGPT , Claude , Copilot , DeepSeek , Google Gemini and Grok ; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion , Midjourney , and DALL-E ; and text-to-video models such as Veo , LTX and Sora . [ 171 ] [ 172 ] [ 173 ] Companies in a variety of sectors have used generative AI, including those in software development, healthcare, [ 174 ] finance, [ 175 ] entertainment, [ 176 ] customer service, [ 177 ] sales and marketing, [ 178 ] art, writing, [ 179 ] and product design. [ 180 ] Agents Main article: Agentic AI AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants , chatbots , autonomous vehicles , game-playing systems , and industrial robotics . AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks. [ 181 ] [ 182 ] [ 183 ] Web search Microsoft introduced Copilot Search in February 2023 under the name Bing Chat , as a built-in feature for Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app. Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries [ 184 ] and step-by-step reasoning based of information from web publishers, ranked in Bing Search. [ 185 ] For safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content. [ 186 ] Google officially pushed its AI Search at its Google I/O event on 20 May 2025. [ 187 ] It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result. AI Overviews uses Gemini 2.5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content. [ 188 ] Sexuality Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions, [ 189 ] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics ), [ 190 ] AI-generated sexual education content, [ 191 ] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika ). [ 192 ] AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography , raising significant ethical and legal concerns. [ 193 ] AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors. [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Other industry-specific tasks There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. [ 196 ] A few examples are energy storage , medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy , or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions. [ 197 ] [ 198 ] [ 199 ] In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics , classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. During the 2024 Indian elections , US$50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages. [ 200 ] Ethics Main article: Ethics of artificial intelligence Street art in Tel Aviv [ 201 ] [ 202 ] AI has potential benefits and potential risks. [ 203 ] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". [ 204 ] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. [ 205 ] [ 206 ] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. [ 207 ] Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy , surveillance and copyright . AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. [ 208 ] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. [ 209 ] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy . [ 210 ] AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation , de-identification and differential privacy . [ 211 ] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork , have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness . Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\" [ 212 ] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \" fair use \". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". [ 213 ] [ 214 ] Website owners can indicate that they do not want their content scraped via a \" robots.txt \" file. [ 215 ] However, some companies will scrape content regardless [ 216 ] [ 217 ] because the robots.txt file has no real authority. In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen ) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. [ 218 ] [ 219 ] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors. [ 220 ] Dominance by tech giants The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. , Amazon , Apple Inc. , Meta Platforms , and Microsoft . [ 221 ] [ 222 ] [ 223 ] Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers , allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace. [ 224 ] [ 225 ] Power needs and environmental impacts See also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence Fueled by growth in artificial intelligence, data centers' demand for power increased in the 2020s. [ 226 ] In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026 , forecasting electric power use. [ 227 ] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation. [ 228 ] Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms. [ 229 ] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge , found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. [ 230 ] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all. [ 231 ] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million. [ 232 ] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. [ 233 ] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission . If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act . [ 234 ] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation. [ 235 ] After the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages. [ 236 ] Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025. [ 236 ] On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban. [ 236 ] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident , according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. [ 237 ] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. [ 237 ] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. [ 238 ] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips , it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors. [ 238 ] In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300–500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it. [ 239 ] Misinformation See also: Content moderation YouTube , Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation , conspiracy theories , and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. [ 240 ] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. [ 241 ] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem. [ 242 ] In the early 2020s, generative AI began to create images, audio, and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing, [ 243 ] while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s. [ 244 ] [ 245 ] [ 246 ] It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda; [ 247 ] one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda . [ 248 ] AI pioneer and Nobel Prize-winning computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks. [ 249 ] The ability to influence electorates has been proved in at least one study. This same study shows more inaccurate statements from the models when they advocate for candidates of the political right. [ 250 ] AI researchers at Microsoft , OpenAI , universities and other organisations have suggested using \" personhood credentials \" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models. [ 251 ] Algorithmic bias and fairness Main articles: Algorithmic bias and Fairness (machine learning) Machine learning applications can be biased [ k ] if they learn from biased data. [ 253 ] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists. [ 254 ] Discriminatory behavior by some LLMs can be observed in their output. [ 255 ] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. [ 256 ] [ 253 ] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine , finance , recruitment , housing or policing ) then the algorithm may cause discrimination . [ 257 ] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On 28 June 2015, Google Photos 's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, [ 258 ] a problem called \"sample size disparity\". [ 259 ] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. [ 260 ] COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist . In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. [ 261 ] In 2017, several researchers [ l ] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. [ 263 ] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". [ 264 ] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\" [ 265 ] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations , some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. [ 266 ] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive. [ m ] Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women. [ 259 ] There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness , which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws . [ 252 ] At the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency a paper reported that a CLIP‑based ( Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training ) robotic system reproduced harmful gender‑ and race‑linked stereotypes in a simulated manipulation task. The authors recommended robot‑learning methods which physically manifest such harms be \"paused, reworked, or even wound down when appropriate, until outcomes can be proven safe, effective, and just.\" [ 268 ] [ 269 ] [ 270 ] Lack of transparency See also: Explainable AI , Algorithmic transparency , and Right to explanation Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. [ 271 ] Particularly with deep neural networks , in which there are many non- linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist. [ 272 ] It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. [ 273 ] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading. [ 274 ] People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation. [ 275 ] Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. [ n ] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used. [ 276 ] DARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems. [ 277 ] Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. [ 278 ] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model. [ 279 ] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. [ 280 ] Deconvolution , DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning. [ 281 ] For generative pre-trained transformers , Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts. [ 282 ] Bad actors and weaponized AI Main articles: Lethal autonomous weapon , Artificial intelligence arms race , and AI safety Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors , such as authoritarian governments , terrorists , criminals or rogue states . A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. [ o ] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction . [ 284 ] Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person . [ 284 ] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations ' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons , however the United States and others disagreed. [ 285 ] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots. [ 286 ] AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance . Machine learning , operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision-making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets . It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware . [ 287 ] All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China. [ 288 ] [ 289 ] There are many other ways in which AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours. [ 290 ] Technological unemployment Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. [ 291 ] In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI. [ 292 ] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment , but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed . [ 293 ] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". [ p ] [ 295 ] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. [ 291 ] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. [ 296 ] [ 297 ] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". [ 298 ] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. [ 299 ] In July 2025, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that \"artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.\" [ 300 ] From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum , about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. [ 301 ] Existential risk Main article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence Recent public debates in artificial intelligence have increasingly focused on its broader societal and ethical implications. It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \" spell the end of the human race \". [ 302 ] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. [ q ] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of an automated paperclip factory that destroys the world to get more iron for paperclips). [ 304 ] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" [ 305 ] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\". [ 306 ] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies , law , government , money and the economy are built on language ; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. [ 307 ] Geoffrey Hinton said in 2025 that modern AI is particularly \"good at persuasion\" and getting better all the time. He asks \"Suppose you wanted to invade the capital of the US. Do you have to go there and do it yourself? No. You just have to be good at persuasion.\" [ 308 ] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. [ 309 ] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates , and Elon Musk , [ 310 ] as well as AI pioneers such as Geoffrey Hinton , Yoshua Bengio , Stuart Russell , Demis Hassabis , and Sam Altman , have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\". [ 311 ] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover , [ 312 ] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. [ 313 ] In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\". [ 314 ] Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" [ 315 ] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" [ 316 ] [ 317 ] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" [ 318 ] Yann LeCun \", a Turing Award winner, disagreed with the idea that AI will subordinate humans \"simply because they are smarter, let alone destroy [us]\", [ 319 ] \"scoff[ing] at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" [ 320 ] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. [ 321 ] However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research. [ 322 ] Ethical machines and alignment Main articles: Machine ethics , AI safety , Friendly artificial intelligence , Artificial moral agents , and Human Compatible See also: Human-AI interaction Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky , who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. [ 323 ] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. [ 324 ] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, [ 324 ] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. [ 325 ] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach 's \"artificial moral agents\" [ 326 ] and Stuart J. Russell 's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. [ 327 ] Open source See also: Open-source artificial intelligence and Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face , [ 328 ] Google , [ 329 ] EleutherAI and Meta . [ 330 ] Various AI models, such as Llama 2 , Mistral or Stable Diffusion , have been made open-weight, [ 331 ] [ 332 ] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned , which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. [ 333 ] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism ) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. [ 334 ] Frameworks Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows: [ 335 ] [ 336 ] Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference , the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; [ 337 ] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks. [ 338 ] Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. [ 339 ] The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. [ 340 ] Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence , Regulation of algorithms , and AI safety The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. [ 341 ] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. [ 342 ] According to AI Index at Stanford , the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. [ 343 ] [ 344 ] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. [ 345 ] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada , China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. [ 345 ] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. [ 345 ] Henry Kissinger , Eric Schmidt , and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. [ 346 ] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. [ 347 ] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics. [ 348 ] On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation. [ 349 ] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \" Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law \". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories. [ 350 ] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". [ 343 ] A 2023 Reuters /Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. [ 351 ] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\". [ 352 ] [ 353 ] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. [ 354 ] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. [ 355 ] [ 356 ] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit , 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. [ 357 ] [ 358 ] History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence . In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [ 359 ] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [ 359 ] The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing 's theory of computation , which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. [ 360 ] [ 361 ] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics , information theory and neurobiology , led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". [ r ] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, [ 363 ] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, [ 117 ] and Turing's influential 1950 paper ' Computing Machinery and Intelligence ', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible. [ 364 ] [ 361 ] The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. [ s ] [ 6 ] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. [ t ] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": [ u ] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. [ v ] [ 7 ] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. [ 361 ] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. [ 368 ] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". [ 369 ] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\". [ 370 ] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. [ w ] In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill [ 372 ] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects . [ 373 ] Minsky and Papert 's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. [ 374 ] The \" AI winter \", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. [ 9 ] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems , [ 375 ] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research . [ 8 ] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began. [ 10 ] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception , robotics , learning and pattern recognition , [ 376 ] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. [ 377 ] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. [ x ] Judea Pearl , Lotfi Zadeh , and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. [ 87 ] [ 382 ] But the most important development was the revival of \" connectionism \", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. [ 383 ] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks. [ 384 ] AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \" narrow \" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics , economics and mathematics ). [ 385 ] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect ). [ 386 ] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s. [ 68 ] Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. [ 11 ] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned. [ y ] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements ( faster computers , [ 388 ] graphics processing units , cloud computing [ 389 ] ) and access to large amounts of data [ 390 ] (including curated datasets, [ 389 ] such as ImageNet ). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. [ z ] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019. [ 345 ] The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022. In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. [ 322 ] In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo , developed by DeepMind , beat the world champion Go player . The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. [ 391 ] ChatGPT , launched on 30 November 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. [ 392 ] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. [ 393 ] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom , where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". [ 394 ] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. [ 395 ] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. [ 396 ] Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. [ 397 ] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. [ 398 ] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will . [ 399 ] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI . [ 398 ] Defining artificial intelligence See also: Synthetic intelligence , Intelligent agent , Artificial mind , Virtual intelligence , and Dartmouth workshop Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" [ 400 ] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". [ 400 ] He devised the Turing test , which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. [ 364 ] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\" [ 401 ] The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. [ 402 ] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. [ 1 ] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \" Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ' \" [ 403 ] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\". [ 404 ] McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". [ 405 ] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky , similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". [ 406 ] Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] The many differing definitiuons of AI have been critically analyzed. [ 407 ] [ 408 ] [ 409 ] During the 2020s AI boom, the term has been used as a marketing buzzword to promote products and services which do not use AI. [ 410 ] Legal definitions The International Organization for Standardization describes an AI system as a \"an engineered system that generates outputs such as content, forecasts, recommendations, or decisions for a given set of human‑defined objectives, and can operate with varying levels of automation\". [ 411 ] The EU AI Act defines an AI system as \"a machine-based system that is designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment, and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments\". [ 412 ] In the United States, influential but non‑binding guidance such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology 's AI Risk Management Framework describes an AI system as \"an engineered or machine-based system that can, for a given set of objectives, generate outputs such as predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy\". [ 413 ] Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. [ aa ] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic , soft and narrow . Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or \" GOFAI \") [ 415 ] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis : \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" [ 416 ] However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning . Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. [ 417 ] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. [ 418 ] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. [ ab ] [ 16 ] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias . Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, [ 420 ] [ 421 ] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI : it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies \"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic , optimization , or neural networks ). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [ 422 ] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both. Soft vs. hard computing Main article: Soft computing Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. [ 15 ] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms , fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. [ 423 ] [ 424 ] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind Main articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness There is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind , consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" [ 425 ] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction . Consciousness Main articles: Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness. [ 426 ] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like . [ 427 ] Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam . [ 428 ] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \" strong AI \": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" [ ac ] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. [ 432 ] AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. [ 433 ] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. [ 434 ] [ 435 ] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness ) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. [ 434 ] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. [ 436 ] In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. [ 437 ] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights , and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own. [ 438 ] [ 439 ] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming , which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited. [ 435 ] [ 434 ] Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. [ 424 ] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself . The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \" intelligence explosion \" and Vernor Vinge called a \" singularity \". [ 440 ] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve , slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. [ 441 ] Transhumanism Main article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec , cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger . [ 442 ] Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler 's \" Darwin among the Machines \" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence . [ 443 ] In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R. , the title standing for \"Rossum's Universal Robots\". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, [ 444 ] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction . [ 445 ] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000 , the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. [ 446 ] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \" Multivac \" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; [ 447 ] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity. [ 448 ] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel , and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek 's R.U.R. , the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina , as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? , by Philip K. Dick . Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] ^ \"Rational agent\" is general term used in economics , philosophy and theoretical artificial intelligence. It can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals, such as a person, an animal, a corporation, a nation, or in the case of AI, a computer program. ^ Alan Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \". [ 42 ] In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, Ray Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: \"An Inductive Inference Machine\". [ 43 ] ^ See AI winter § Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966 . ^ Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve. [ 94 ] ^ Expectation–maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables . [ 96 ] ^ Some form of deep neural networks (without a specific learning algorithm) were described by: Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) [ 117 ] Alan Turing (1948); [ 118 ] Karl Steinbuch and Roger David Joseph (1961). [ 119 ] Deep or recurrent networks that learned (or used gradient descent) were developed by: Frank Rosenblatt (1957); [ 118 ] Oliver Selfridge (1959); [ 119 ] Alexey Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa (1965); [ 120 ] Kaoru Nakano (1971); [ 121 ] Shun-Ichi Amari (1972); [ 121 ] John Joseph Hopfield (1982). [ 121 ] Precursors to backpropagation were developed by: Henry J. Kelley (1960); [ 118 ] Arthur E. Bryson (1962); [ 118 ] Stuart Dreyfus (1962); [ 118 ] Arthur E. Bryson and Yu-Chi Ho (1969); [ 118 ] Backpropagation was independently developed by: Seppo Linnainmaa (1970); [ 122 ] Paul Werbos (1974). [ 118 ] ^ Geoffrey Hinton said, of his work on neural networks in the 1990s, \"our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small. [And] our computers were millions of times too slow.\" [ 123 ] ^ In statistics, a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value. But in the context of fairness , it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful. A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense. [ 252 ] ^ Including Jon Kleinberg ( Cornell University ), Sendhil Mullainathan ( University of Chicago ), Cynthia Chouldechova ( Carnegie Mellon ) and Sam Corbett-Davis ( Stanford ) [ 262 ] ^ Moritz Hardt (a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems ) argues that machine learning \"is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains, where you're trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world.\" [ 267 ] ^ When the law was passed in 2018, it still contained a form of this provision. ^ This is the United Nations ' definition, and includes things like land mines as well. [ 283 ] ^ See table 4; 9% is both the OECD average and the U.S. average. [ 294 ] ^ Sometimes called a \" robopocalypse \" [ 303 ] ^ \"Electronic brain\" was the term used by the press around this time. [ 360 ] [ 362 ] ^ Daniel Crevier wrote, \"the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science.\" [ 365 ] Russell and Norvig called the conference \"the inception of artificial intelligence.\" [ 117 ] ^ Russell and Norvig wrote \"for the next 20 years the field would be dominated by these people and their students.\" [ 366 ] ^ Russell and Norvig wrote, \"it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish\". [ 367 ] ^ The programs described are Arthur Samuel 's checkers program for the IBM 701 , Daniel Bobrow 's STUDENT , Newell and Simon 's Logic Theorist and Terry Winograd 's SHRDLU . ^ Russell and Norvig write: \"in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult problems\" [ 371 ] ^ Embodied approaches to AI [ 378 ] were championed by Hans Moravec [ 379 ] and Rodney Brooks [ 380 ] and went by many names: Nouvelle AI . [ 380 ] Developmental robotics . [ 381 ] ^ Matteo Wong wrote in The Atlantic : \"Whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as natural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different methods, now they all use a programming method called \"deep learning\". As a result, their code and approaches have become more similar, and their models are easier to integrate into one another.\" [ 387 ] ^ Jack Clark wrote in Bloomberg : \"After a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year. Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever\", and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at Google increased from a \"sporadic usage\" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects in 2015. [ 389 ] ^ Nils Nilsson wrote in 1983: \"Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about.\" [ 414 ] ^ Daniel Crevier wrote that \"time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier.\" [ 419 ] ^ Searle presented this definition of \"Strong AI\" in 1999. [ 429 ] Searle's original formulation was \"The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.\" [ 430 ] Strong AI is defined similarly by Russell and Norvig : \"Stong AI – the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking).\" [ 431 ] References ^ Jump up to: a b c Russell & Norvig (2021) , pp. 1–4. ^ AI set to exceed human brain power Archived 19 February 2008 at the Wayback Machine CNN.com (26 July 2006) ^ Kaplan, Andreas; Haenlein, Michael (2019). \"Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

        "text": "AI data center - Wikipedia Jump to content Participate in Wiki Loves Punjab 2026 (Let's document Visuals from Villages of Punjab) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Specialized data centers designed for artificial intelligence An AI data center (sometimes known as an AI factory [ 1 ] ) is a specialized data center facility designed for the computationally intensive tasks of training and running inference for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models. Unlike general-purpose data centers, they are optimized for the parallel processing demands of AI workloads, typically utilizing hardware such as AI accelerators (e.g., GPUs , TPUs ) and high-speed interconnects. The global push to construct these specialized facilities accelerated dramatically during the AI boom of the 2020s. This demand has reshaped supply chains, driving memory manufacturers to prioritize production of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) essential for AI servers, which has led to a global memory supply shortage , and triggering a broader competition for advanced chips, power, and infrastructure. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Major tech companies are estimated to spend $650 billion on AI data centers in 2026. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Architecture [ edit ] Data centers for building and running large machine learning models contained specialized computer chips, GPUs , that used 2-4 times as much energy as their regular CPU counterparts (250-500 watts). [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Companies such as Google and Nvidia constructed GPUs specifically for machine learning, which could process thousands of calculations per second. Thousands of these GPUs were stored closely together in data centers, alongside specialized hardware and cables to quickly migrate data between these chips. To cool these systems, AI data centers have developed new techniques for doing so. Google pumps large amounts of water through its data centers, using pipes that run next to the computer chips, which can strain nearby water supplies. Cirrascale uses large chillers to cool the water, which is largely recycled, but uses more electricity. [ 8 ] According to PCMag , AI data centers use 60+ kilowatts of power per server rack , whereas more standard data centers typically use 5-10 kilowatts per rack. [ 3 ] American Big Tech companies have described these facilities as essential to building artificial general intelligence . [ 8 ] The term AI factory , coined by Nvidia 's CEO Jensen Huang , has been used as an alternative phrase for AI data center by some technology companies. [ 1 ] Operators [ edit ] As of August 2025, The Information tracked 18 planned or existing AI data centers in the United States, operated by Amazon Web Services , CoreWeave , Crusoe, Meta , Microsoft / OpenAI , Oracle , Tesla , and xAI . [ 9 ] Other AI data center operators include Digital Realty and Alibaba . [ 10 ] Data centers are also being built in China, India, Europe, [ 10 ] Saudi Arabia, [ 11 ] and Canada. [ 12 ] The New Yorker described CoreWeave as the most prominent AI data center operator in the United States. [ 13 ] Two types of data center providers for machine learning have been noted: hyperscalers and neoclouds. The Verge listed large technology companies such as Google, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle and Amazon as hyperscalers. [ 14 ] The New York Times described neoclouds as \"a new generation of data center providers\". CoreWeave, Nebius, Nscale, and Lambda have been described as examples of neoclouds. [ 15 ] In January 2025, OpenAI, in partnership with Oracle and Softbank , announced the Stargate project, which as of September 2025 is composed of six built or proposed AI data centers in the United States. [ 16 ] In response to the Stargate project, Amazon launched in October 2025 an AI data center on 1,200 acres of farmland in Indiana. This data center, known as Project Rainier, is one of the largest AI data centers in the world, with Amazon spending $11 billion on the project. Rainier is specifically intended for training and running machine learning models from Anthropic . [ 17 ] As of that time, this facility contains seven data centers (out of an estimated 30 planned) and will use 2.2 gigawatts of electricity (equivalent to 1 million households) and millions of gallons of water per year. Computer chips from Annapurna Labs and Anthropic, Trainium 2, were designed for use in such facilities. Amazon pumped millions of gallons of water out of the ground to construct the data center, and as of June 2025, Indiana state officials are investigating whether this dewatering process led to dry wells for local residents. [ 18 ] In November 2025, Anthropic announced a plan in partnership with Fluidstack to develop artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States, including data centers in New York and Texas, worth $50 billion. [ 19 ] Other AI data center projects include the Colossus supercomputer from xAI, a Louisiana-based project from Meta, Hyperion, expected to use 5 GW of power, and a second Ohio-based Meta project, Prometheus, with a capacity of 1 GW. [ 20 ] A 3,200-acre AI data center, capable of 4.4-4.5 GW of power and located on the decommissioned Homer City Generating Station , is under construction as of 2025, and will use seven 30-acre gas generating stations supplied by EQT . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] As of December 2025, CRH is working on over 100 data centers in the United States. [ 23 ] In 2025, ExxonMobil and NextEra announced plans to build a data center powered by natural gas and using carbon capture technology , with 1.2 GW of power capacity. They previously purchased 2,500 acres of land in the Southeastern United States and plan to market the data center to an artificial intelligence company. [ 24 ] The increased interest in AI data centers has led to several executives from companies in that space becoming billionaires, including CoreWeave, QTS , Nebius , Astera Labs , Groq , Fermi (which is connected to former United States Secretary of Energy Rick Perry ), Snowflake and Cipher Mining. [ 25 ] Several companies involved in cryptocurrency mining , such as Bitdeer , CoreWeave, [ 26 ] Cipher Mining, TeraWulf , [ 27 ] IREN, Core Scientific, and CleanSpark [ 28 ] have also been involved with AI data centers. Finances [ edit ] Between January and August 2024, Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon collectively spent $125 billion on AI data centers. [ 29 ] Citigroup forecasted that $2.8 trillion would be spent on AI data centers by 2030, [ 10 ] while McKinsey and Company estimated that almost $7 trillion would be spent globally by that time. [ 30 ] According to S&P Global , $61 billion has been spent on the data center market as a whole in 2025, while debt issuance for data centers was $182 billion during the same year. [ 31 ] Large technology companies have offloaded the financial risks of building AI data centers by setting up special purpose vehicles or by contracting with neoclouds. For example, Meta's Hyperion was mostly funded by Blue Owl Capital , which did so using a bond offering from PIMCO . Those bonds were sold to a number of clients, including BlackRock . Meta did not borrow money itself and instead established a special purpose vehicle from which it would rent the data center. [ 15 ] This deal was structured by Morgan Stanley for $30 billion, the largest known private capital transaction as of 2025. [ 26 ] Neoclouds such as CoreWeave have gone into debt to buy computer chips from Nvidia for their data centers, and the chips themselves have been used for loan collateral. As of December 2025, CoreWeave took out three GPU-backed loans, collectively worth $12.4 billion, from private credit firms ( Blackstone , Coatue , BlackRock , PIMCO ) and from banks ( Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo ). Thus, these companies provide an indirect connection between private credit and established banks. Data centers have also established asset-backed securities , and debt for data centers has its own derivative financial products . [ 14 ] The real estate industry , including asset managers , public companies and private investors , has also invested in data centers. [ 32 ] Energy sourcing [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Data center § Energy use . [ edit ] Fueled by growth in artificial intelligence, data centers' demand for power increased in the 2020s. [ 33 ] Google Data Center , The Dalles, Oregon Energy consumption is a central issue for data centers. Power draw ranges from a few kilowatts (kW) for small server racks to several tens of megawatts (MW) for large facilities. Modern hyperscale data centers can exhibit power densities exceeding 100 times those of conventional office buildings, primarily due to the high concentration of servers and cooling systems required to manage continuous digital workloads. [ 34 ] For higher power density facilities, electricity costs are a dominant operating expense and account for over 10% of the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a data center. [ 35 ] As of 2024, data centers in the United States are primarily powered by natural gas, which supplies 40% of their electricity (with renewable energy at 24%, nuclear at about 20% and coal at about 15%). [ 36 ] The Associated Press reported that electricity for AI data centers in the United States would likely come from natural gas or oil, as companies prefer using currently available power plants, which primarily use fossil fuels. Fossil energy is also often cheaper in locations where data centers are developed, and experts believe that energy demands from generative AI and data centers would be difficult to fulfill with renewable energy alone. Some companies such as Google, Amazon and Meta have expressed interest in nuclear power for their data centers. [ 37 ] Other data centers, including xAI's Colossus , OpenAI's Stargate , and Meta's Prometheus use their own off-grid natural gas plants . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Electric vehicle and lithium-ion batteries have also been used for powering data centers, including for Colossus. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Power utility companies make upgrades to their infrastructure to handle demands of new data centers, and the price for these changes typically falls on consumers: [ 36 ] [ 37 ] smaller businesses or individual households. [ 36 ] In December 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission published a unanimous order allowing data centers in the United States to have a direct connection with power plants . [ 42 ] United States Secretary of Energy Chris Wright expressed support for un-retiring coal plants to power AI data centers. [ 43 ] Trump paused leasing for offshore wind projects , a decision that Gizmodo criticized due to their potential to provide power to AI data centers. [ 44 ] Electricity demands from AI data centers have slowed or reverssed the retirement of peaking power plants in the United States. [ 45 ] Environmental footprint [ edit ] See also: Environmental impact of artificial intelligence Average AI data centers have an electricity footprint equivalent to 100,000 households, and use billions of gallons of water for cooling their hardware. [ 46 ] In 2025, the International Energy Agency estimated that the larger AI data centers currently under construction could consume as much electricity as 2 million households. [ 7 ] A 2024 report from the United States Department of Energy stated that data centers overall used 17 billion gallons of water per year in the United States, primarily due to \"rapid proliferation of AI servers\", and that this usage was forecasted to grow to nearly 80 billion gallons by 2028. [ 30 ] Researchers estimated that AI data centers in the United States would emit 24-44 metric tons of carbon dioxide and use 731–1,125 million cubic meters of water per year between 2024 and 2030. [ 47 ] Peaking power plants, which have been proposed as a power source for AI data centers, emit sulfur dioxide and have historically been located disproportionately near communities of color in the United States. [ 48 ] Reciprocating internal combustion engines, proposed as another power source for a data center, emit PM 2.5 , nitrogen oxides , and volatile organic compounds . [ 49 ] AI data centers in the United States [ edit ] Data center infrastructure in the United States In the United States, both the Biden administration and second Trump administration supported the construction of AI data centers. In January 2025, then-president Joe Biden signed an executive order for federal government agencies to support AI data centers on federal sites built by private companies, study their effect on energy prices, and encourage their use of renewable energy. [ 50 ] In April 2025, the United States Department of Energy suggested 16 possible sites, including Los Alamos National Laboratory , Sandia National Laboratories and Oak Ridge National Laboratory . [ 51 ] In its July 2025 AI Action Plan, the second Trump administration supported increased production of AI data centers. [ 52 ] Several states in the country have incentivized local data center construction. [ 53 ] For example, in 2024, lawmakers in Michigan approved tax breaks for data center equipment and construction material. [ 54 ] Some data center companies have also invested or promised to invest in the infrastructure of local communities. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] In December 2025, Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren , Chris Van Hollen , and Richard Blumenthal wrote to seven technology companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, CoreWeave, Digital Realty, and Equinix ) that they will investigate the effects of those companies' operations on consumer energy bills, highlighting AI data centers in particular. [ 57 ] That same month, 25 Democratic lawmakers wrote to the inspector general of the United States Department of Commerce over possible conflict of interest concerns involving secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick and AI data centers. Lutnick met with a co-founder of Fermi, which proposed an AI data center project financed by Cantor Fitzgerald and Newmark Group . [ 58 ] AI Infrastructure Coalition (AIIC), an organization led by Brian O. Walsh, Kyrsten Sinema , and Garret Graves , has supported Trump's AI Action Plan, [ 59 ] with Sinema becoming personally involved in a local meeting on an AI data center in Arizona. [ 60 ] Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz , Big Tech companies (Google, Meta, Microsoft), telecommunications companies ( Cisco , Corning Inc. , Lumen Technologies ), data center providers (Digital Realty, QTS), energy companies ( Duke Energy , Entergy , ExxonMobil, NextEra Energy), and utility companies ( PG&E , Pinnacle West Capital ) are members of AIIC as of November 2025. [ 59 ] AIIC has been supported by Hogan Lovells . [ 60 ] Concerns and opposition [ edit ] Some analysts have expressed concerns about overbuilding of AI data centers, warning that their infrastructure risks obsolescence due to changes in demand and technology. [ 23 ] Estimates for the lifespan of the GPUs used to power data centers range from one to eight years. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] By contrast, CPUs in more traditional data centers have a shelf life of about 5–7 years. Machine learning model training causes significant stress on computer chips. [ 63 ] The increased costs and shortages of computer memory, including High Bandwidth Memory , DRAM and NAND flash memory , have been attributed to the AI data center boom. [ 2 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Increased prices and smaller memory storage for smart devices have also been linked to the AI data center boom. [ 66 ] An agreement with Samsung and SK Hynix would supply the Stargate project with 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, about 40% of all DRAM produced worldwide. [ 67 ] As of 2025, Data Center Watch reported that multiple data center projects collectively worth $64 billion had been stopped or delayed. [ 68 ] Political opposition in the United States has been bipartisan. [ 69 ] Local communities in Texas, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, [ 68 ] Florida, [ 70 ] Michigan, [ 71 ] Minnesota, Wisconsin, [ 72 ] Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, Arizona, [ 73 ] Indiana, Virginia, [ 74 ] Maryland, [ 75 ] Georgia, [ 76 ] North Carolina, [ 77 ] Illinois, [ 78 ] and Oregon [ 60 ] have resisted these projects. Critics have pointed out that jobs created by data centers tend to be temporary or few in number. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Residents have been concerned about air , water and noise pollution , [ 82 ] as well as property devaluation , [ 75 ] traffic , [ 83 ] and the risk of fires. [ 84 ] Other environmental concerns involving AI data centers include e-waste [ 85 ] and construction materials that emit greenhouse gases such as concrete and cement . [ 86 ] Advocates have also linked data center construction to the AI bubble . [ 82 ] [ 87 ] Wisconsin Watch expressed concern that data centers could become stranded assets in the context of an AI bubble, leaving energy customers to pay for the costs. [ 88 ] Journalists have warned that the large number of links between actors and organizations in the AI ecosystem [ 14 ] as well as the large number of companies involved [ 26 ] each indicate strong risks for the global economy and financial markets . A hedge fund founder questioned the economics of AI data centers, concluding that they need about $1 trillion of revenue for profitability. [ 89 ] In November 2025, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned that building new data centers could negatively affect the electrical grid and cause power outages during extreme weather . [ 72 ] The independent monitor of PJM Interconnection warned that its power grid cannot support new data centers and supported a federal moratorium on data centers. [ 21 ] Machine learning developers, when training large language models , often use data centers at their full capacity, conflicting with other users (including households) during peak usage, which may lead to blackouts . [ 72 ] Power disruptions in data centers can cause errors in machine learning model calculations (\"silent data corruption\"). [ 90 ] Large technology companies who are building data centers have asked public officials and land owners to sign non-disclosure agreements and have appeared to use shell companies . [ 73 ] In one case, when a joint OpenAI-Oracle data center was rejected by Saline Township in Michigan, landowners and developers responded by suing the town. [ 54 ] [ 83 ] The developers acquired the land from the resulting settlement. The Michigan Public Service Commission approved DTE Energy to provide power to the data center, part of Stargate. The approval was part of an ex parte motion, with no public input. [ 55 ] In 2025, over 230 groups have signed a letter supporting a moratorium on constructing AI data centers in the United States, concerned by impact on the environment and energy bills. Signatories include Food & Water Watch , Greenpeace , Friends of the Earth and Physicians for Social Responsibility . [ 91 ] Senator Bernie Sanders has also supported a moratorium on AI data centers. [ 92 ] Ashley LaMont, of Honor the Earth , argued that data centers on tribal lands would not help Native Americans obtain data sovereignty . [ 93 ] The NAACP has also expressed opposition to AI data centers. [ 94 ] AI data centers in space [ edit ] See also: Space-based data center Several tech companies, including Starcloud , Google, Nvidia, Blue Origin and SpaceX , have announced projects for or otherwise expressed interest in building data centers in outer space . [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Google announced Project Suncatcher, which plans to test whether its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chips (which are specifically designed for machine learning) can function in the environment of space. The company aims to deploy satellites with these chips in a data center by 2027. [ 99 ] In November 2025, Starcloud, a startup supported by Nvidia, launched a satellite with an Nvidia H100 GPU that the company used to deploy and develop a large language model. CNBC reported that this model, NanoGPT, was the first model trained in space. Starcloud deployed a second model based on Google's Gemma .

[ 1 ] Salesforce, Inc. , is an American cloud -based software company headquartered in San Francisco , California. It provides applications focused on sales , customer service , marketing automation , e-commerce , analytics , artificial intelligence , agentic AI , and application development. Founded by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff in March 1999, Salesforce grew quickly, making its initial public offering in 2004.

[ 8 ] Two of Salesforce's earliest investors were Larry Ellison , the co-founder and first CEO of Oracle , and Halsey Minor , the founder of CNET . [ 7 ] Salesforce was severely affected by the dot-com bubble bursting at the beginning of the new millennium, resulting in the company laying off 20% of its workforce. Despite its losses, Salesforce continued strong during the early 2000s. Salesforce also gained notability during this period for its \"the end of software\" tagline and marketing campaign, and even hired actors to hold up signs with its slogan outside a Siebel Systems conference. [ 9 ] Salesforce's revenue continued to increase, moving from $5.4 million in 2000 to $22.4 million in 2001. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In 2003, Salesforce held its first annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. [ 12 ] There were around 1,300 attendees and 50 exhibitors at the conference. [ 13 ] In June 2004, the company had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110 million. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In 2006, Salesforce launched Idea Exchange, a platform that allows customers to connect with company product managers. [ 16 ] In 2009, Salesforce passed $1 billion in annual revenue. [ 7 ] Also, in 2009, the company launched Service Cloud, an application that helps companies manage service conversations about their products and services. [ 17 ] In 2014, the company released Trailhead, a free online learning platform. [ 18 ] In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform. [ 19 ] In September 2016, Salesforce announced the launch of Einstein, an artificial intelligence platform that supports several of Salesforce's cloud services. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Salesforce licensed the right to use Albert Einstein 's image and likeness from the Einstein Estate under a 20-year agreement for $20 million, restricted to business software applications. [ 22 ] Salesforce launched the Sustainability Cloud (Net Zero Cloud as of 2022 [update] ), which is used by companies to track progress towards achieving their net zero emissions goals. [ 23 ] In 2020, Salesforce joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average , replacing energy giant and Standard Oil -descendant ExxonMobil . [ 24 ] Salesforce's ascension to the Dow Jones was concurrent with that of Amgen and Honeywell . [ 5 ] Because the Dow Jones factors its components by market price, Salesforce was the largest technology component of the index at its accession. [ 25 ] Salesforce experienced significant leadership transitions between 2020 and 2021; Keith Block stepped down as co-CEO in February 2020, [ 26 ] leaving Marc Benioff as sole chairman and CEO. [ 27 ] In February 2021, Weaver, previously the chief legal officer, became CFO, where she served until stepping down in August 2024. [ 28 ] Former CFO Mark Hawkins announced that he would be retiring in October. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] In November 2021, Bret Taylor was named vice chair and co-CEO of the company alongside Benioff. [ 31 ] In December 2020, Salesforce announced its acquisition of Slack for $27.7 billion, the largest in company history; [ 32 ] the deal closed in July 2021. [ 33 ] The purchase price represented a 54% premium over Slack's closing market capitalization at the announcement date, valued at approximately $18 billion. Salesforce justified the premium based on anticipated synergies from integrating Slack's messaging platform with its CRM services. [ 34 ] [ better source needed ] In April 2022, \"Salesforce.com, Inc.\" changed its legal name to \"Salesforce, Inc.\" [ 35 ] In August 2022, Salesforce surpassed SAP in total revenue and market capitalization to become the world's largest enterprise applications software company, according to industry analysis. [ 3 ] The next month, Salesforce announced a partnership with Meta Platforms . The deal called for Meta's consumer application WhatsApp to integrate Salesforce's Customer 360 platform to allow consumers to communicate with companies directly. [ 36 ] In November 2022, Salesforce announced it would terminate some employees from its sales team. [ 37 ] That same month, Salesforce announced its co-CEO and vice chair, Bret Taylor, would be stepping down from his roles at the end of January 2023, with Benioff continuing to run the company and serve as board chair. Within the week, former Tableau CEO Mark Nelson and former Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield also announced their departures. When asked about departures, Benioff stated, 'people come and people go.' Following these executive transitions, Salesforce's stock declined significantly, with market analysts attributing the decline to concerns about leadership stability and strategic continuity. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] In January 2023, the company announced a layoff of about 10%, or approximately 8,000 positions. According to Benioff, the company hired too aggressively during the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in working from home led to the layoff. The company also reduced office space as part of the restructuring plan. [ 42 ] The same month brought an announcement from activist investor Elliott Management that it would acquire a \"big stake\" in the company. [ 43 ] In January 2024, Salesforce announced it was laying off 700 employees (about 1%) of its global staff. [ 44 ] In October 2025, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff declared his avid support of Donald Trump and urged him to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco as Trump was deploying federal troops to other cities . [ 45 ] The comments generated significant controversy for Benioff and Salesforce, [ 46 ] including push-back from San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie and District Attorney Brooke Jenkins [ 47 ] and the resignation of Ron Conway from the Salesforce Foundation board. [ 48 ] Benioff subsequently apologized for his National Guard comments. [ 49 ] That same month, Salesforce pitched the Trump administration on ways that Salesforce's AI tools could help Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) triple its staff to support the administration's mass deportation campaign . [ 50 ] The company had previously contracted for ICE under the Obama and Biden administrations. [ 50 ] Services [ edit ] Salesforce offers several customer relationship management (CRM) services, including: Sales Cloud, [ 51 ] Service Cloud, [ 52 ] Marketing Cloud , [ 53 ] and Commerce Cloud and Platform. [ 53 ] Additional technologies include Slack . Other services include app creation, data integration and visualization, and training. [ 54 ] Salesforce launched a suite of features called Salesforce Foundations in September 2024, bundling connected functionality across department-specific Sales Cloud and Service Cloud products. [ 55 ] Artificial intelligence [ edit ] Launched at Dreamforce in 2016, Salesforce Einstein was the company's first artificial intelligence product, developed from a set of technologies underlying the Salesforce platform. [ 56 ] In March 2023, Salesforce announced ChatGPT integration in Slack was available to any organization, and the launch of Einstein GPT, a generative AI service. [ 57 ] In March 2024, Salesforce launched Einstein Copilot: Health Actions, a conversation assistant based on its earlier artificial intelligence platform Einstein. It helps with making appointments, referrals, and gathering patient information. [ 58 ] In July, Salesforce released an AI agent, the Einstein Service Agent, with the ability to perform customer service actions, like enabling product returns or refunds. [ 59 ] In September 2024, the company deployed Agentforce (succeeding Salesforce Einstein), an agentic AI platform where users can create autonomous agents for customer service assistance, developing marketing campaigns, and coaching salespersons. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff stated in a June 2025 interview on The Circuit that artificial intelligence now performs between 30% and 50% of internal work at Salesforce, including functions such as software engineering, customer service, marketing, and analytics. [ 63 ] Although he made clear that \"humans still drive the future,\" Benioff noted that AI is enabling the company to reassign employees into higher-value roles rather than reduce headcount. [ 64 ] In December 2025, Salesforce stated that AI agents powered by Agentforce influenced US$67 billion in global sales and resolved over 4.2 billion customer service interactions. [ 65 ] Salesforce Platform [ edit ] Salesforce Platform (formerly known as Force.com) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to add applications to the main Salesforce.com application. [ 66 ] [ failed verification ] These applications are hosted on Salesforce.com infrastructure. [ 67 ] Force.com applications are built using Apex, a proprietary Java -like programming language, [ 68 ] to generate HTML originally via the \"Visualforce\" framework. Beginning in 2015, [ 69 ] the \"Lightning Components\" framework has been supported. The Apex language and compiler were initially designed by Craig Weissman. [ 70 ] As of 2014 [update] , the Force.com platform had 1.5 million registered developers according to Salesforce. [ 10 ] AppExchange [ edit ] Launched in 2005, the Salesforce AppExchange is an online app store that allows users to sell third-party applications and consulting services. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Trailhead [ edit ] Launched in 2014, Trailhead is a free online learning platform with courses focused on Salesforce technologies. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 18 ] Discontinued [ edit ] Desk.com was a SaaS help desk and customer support product acquired by Salesforce for $50 million in 2011, [ 75 ] [ 76 ] and consolidated with other services into Service Cloud Essentials in March 2018. [ 77 ] Do.com was a cloud-based task management system for small groups and businesses, introduced in 2011, and discontinued in 2014. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Operations [ edit ] A discussion panel at Salesforce's Customer Company Tour event that focused on customer relationship management Salesforce is headquartered in San Francisco in the Salesforce Tower . [ 81 ] Salesforce has 110 offices, including offices in Hong Kong, Israel, London , Paris , Sydney and Tokyo . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Salesforce Tower in New York City Standard & Poor's added Salesforce to the S&P 500 Index in September 2008. [ 84 ] In August 2020, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that Salesforce would replace ExxonMobil in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . [ 24 ] Culture [ edit ] According to Marc Benioff, Salesforce corporate culture is based on ' Ohana ,' a Hawaiian concept emphasizing family and community. Benioff has described this philosophy as prioritizing employee well-being and broader stakeholder relationships. [ 85 ] In 2021, Cynthia Perry, a design research senior manager, publicly resigned from Salesforce, posting her resignation letter on LinkedIn and alleging workplace discrimination related to diversity and inclusion practices, and posting her resignation letter on LinkedIn . [ 86 ] On September 10, 2021, Benioff tweeted that the company is prepared to help any employee who wishes to move out of the state of Texas , following abortion legislation in Texas , announced on September 1, 2021. [ 87 ] Finances [ edit ] For the fiscal year 2022, Salesforce reported revenue of US$26.49 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year and 24% in constant currency. [ 88 ] Salesforce ranked 126 on the 2022 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States companies by revenue. [ 89 ] Year [ 90 ] Revenue US$ millions Net income US$ millions Total Assets US$ millions Price per Share US$ Employees 2005 176 7 280 5.19 767 2006 310 28 435 8.62 1,304 2007 497 0 665 11.69 2,070 2008 749 18 1,090 13.43 2,606 2009 1,077 43 1,480 11.37 3,566 2010 1,306 81 2,460 24.21 3,969 2011 1,657 64 3,091 32.93 5,306 2012 2,267 −12 4,164 35.73 7,785 2013 3,050 −270 5,529 45.94 9,800 2014 4,071 −232 9,153 57.26 13,300 2015 5,374 −263 10,665 70.66 16,000 2016 6,667 −47 12,763 74.55 19,000 2017 8,392 180 17,585 90.26 25,000 2018 10,480 127 21,010 132.21 29,000 2019 13,282 1,110 30,737 155.10 35,000 2020 17,098 126 55,126 222.40 49,000 2021 21,252 4,072 66,301 255.33 56,606 2022 26,492 1,444 95,209 132.59 73,541 2023 31,352 208 98,849 79,390 2024 34,857 4,136 99,823 72,682 2025 37,895 6,197 102,928 76,453 IT infrastructure [ edit ] In 2008, Salesforce migrated from Sun Fire E25K servers with SPARC processors running Solaris , to Dell servers with AMD processors, running Linux.

The deal strengthens Salesforce's data integration and governance capabilities across its platform ecosystem. Prior negotiations in 2024 failed due to disagreements over valuation and deal structure. [ 136 ] Cybersecurity incidents [ edit ] 2007 Phishing attack [ edit ] In November 2007, a phishing attack compromised contact information on a number of Salesforce customers. Some customers then received phishing emails that appeared to be invoices from Salesforce. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] A Salesforce employee's credentials were stolen through social engineering. Salesforce stated the incident resulted from human manipulation rather than a software vulnerability in its platform. [ 137 ] 2022 Heroku OAuth token theft (Salesforce subsidiary) [ edit ] On April 13, 2022, GitHub notified Heroku of unauthorized access to its systems through a compromised OAuth token. Heroku immediately revoked all affected tokens and notified customers to update their credentials. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] 2025 targeted campaigns against Salesforce customers (UNC6040 & UNC6395) [ edit ] Modified Data Loader / Vishing - UNC6040 threat actors executed a social engineering (security) campaign in which employees were persuaded to install a tampered version of Salesforce Data Loader. The Trojan horse (computing) client functioned as a malware dropper, enabling credential theft, unauthorized access, and large-scale data exfiltration, which was subsequently used for extortion against multiple organizations. Salesforce confirmed the campaign abused user trust and vishing techniques, clarifying that no vulnerability in the Salesforce platform itself was exploited. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] UNC6395 [ 146 ] threat actors compromised OAuth and refresh tokens through the Salesloft -Drift integration, enabling unauthorized access to Salesforce customer instances for data theft and extortion. According to Google's Threat Intelligence Group, attackers engaged in widespread theft of OAuth tokens via the Salesloft -Drift app to exfiltrate sensitive corporate data, including cloud secrets. [ 147 ] In response, Salesforce and Salesloft revoked all affected Drift tokens and removed the application software from AppExchange pending investigation. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] [ 150 ] Controversies [ edit ] ‘Meatpistol’ presenters fired at Def Con [ edit ] In 2017, two Salesforce security engineers were fired after giving a presentation at DEF CON discussing a Salesforce pentesting framework called MEATPISTOL. [ 151 ] MEATPISTOL was a Salesforce-developed exploit framework similar to (and named after) Metasploit . Salesforce had previously planned to open source the framework, but changed plans just before the presentation, and fired them immediately afterward [ 151 ] The presenters were sent a message half an hour before the presentation telling them to cancel the talk, but they did not see the message until afterward. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] The terminated employees called on the company to open-source the software after being dismissed. [ 153 ] RAICES donation refusal [ edit ] In 2018, the not-for-profit organization Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) rejected a US$250,000 donation from Salesforce, citing the company's contracts to provide technology services to U.S. Customs and Border Protection . RAICES stated that accepting funds from a company supporting immigration enforcement conflicted with its mission to advocate for immigrant and refugee rights. [ 154 ] 2018 taxes [ edit ] According to an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis published in December 2019, Salesforce paid no federal income tax on its 2018 profits, achieving a 0% effective tax rate. The report attributed this to provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and available tax credits and deductions. Their findings were published in a report based on the 379 Fortune 500 companies that declared a profit in 2018. [ 155 ] Sex-trafficking lawsuit [ edit ] In March 2019, Salesforce faced a lawsuit by 50 anonymous women claiming to be victims and survivors of sex trafficking , abuse, and rape, alleging the company profited from and helped build technology that facilitated sex trafficking on the now-defunct Backpage .com. [ 156 ] In March 2021, a judge granted partial dismissal of the case, dismissing charges of negligence and conspiracy, but allowed the case to proceed regarding charges of sex trafficking. [ 157 ] In March 2024, the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs could potentially refile their claims in the future. [ 158 ] In September 2024, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied a motion to reverse the dismissal. [ 159 ] Disability discrimination lawsuit in Japan [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( March 2023 ) In July 2021, a former Salesforce Japan employee sued the company in Tokyo District Court, alleging discrimination based on disabilities (autism and ADHD), including denial of reasonable workplace accommodations. Japanese law requires private companies to employ at least 2.3% disabled employees or pay a mandatory levy. Salesforce Japan failed to meet this threshold from 2009 to 2021 (except 2017) and did not report disabled employee numbers to labor officials in 2020. [ 160 ] The firm declined to comment on the suit to the media. The ex-employee, who is autistic with ADHD , claimed she was discriminated against because of her disability and terminated from the firm's Japanese web marketing team.\nThe suit alleged that the anonymous woman, as an employee at Salesforce Japan from 2018 to 2020, faced hate speech , microaggressions and rejection of reasonable accommodation from the manager. She alleged that her attempts to resolve the problem were met with pressure from HR and job coach. The lawsuit is still continuing in Tokyo district court. [ 161 ] [ 162 ] Depending on the result of lawsuit, the firm may face a negative impact to disability hiring such as a performance improvement plan based on the disability employment act or disclosure as social punishment from the labor official. [ 163 ] Employee layoffs/Matthew McConaughey's salary [ edit ] In January 2023, Salesforce reported that 8,000 employees had been laid off as a result of over-hiring during the COVID-19 lockdowns and a global economic downturn. In March 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported that actor Matthew McConaughey received annual compensation of approximately $10 million as a 'creative advisor and TV pitchman.' The arrangement was disclosed amid scrutiny of executive spending during the company's major 2023 layoffs. American musician will.i.am was also cited as being on the company's payroll due to his \"strong understanding of technology\". [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Wrongful termination lawsuit [ edit ] In September 2024, former Salesforce Senior Director Dina Zelikson filed a lawsuit against the company in San Francisco Superior Court , alleging wrongful termination, discrimination, and retaliation during a medical leave. [ 166 ] 2025 layoffs and CEO declarations [ edit ] In September 2025, Benioff drew criticism after announcing that Salesforce had eliminated approximately 4,000 customer service roles following the deployment of AI-powered support agents. Speaking on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast, he said the company reduced its support workforce from 9,000 to about 5,000 employees because he \"need[ed] less heads.\" According to Salesforce, deployed AI agents handle approximately 50% of customer support interactions, with reported cost reductions of 17% relative to support operations in early 2025. The decision contrasted with Benioff's earlier remarks suggesting that artificial intelligence would augment, rather than replace, white-collar workers. Critics pointed to the layoffs as evidence of an industry-wide trend of replacing human jobs with automation, similar to workforce reductions at Microsoft and Klarna. [ 167 ] Salesforce Ventures [ edit ] In 2009, Salesforce began investing in startups. [ 168 ] These investments became Salesforce Ventures, headed by John Somorjai. [ 168 ] [ 169 ] In September 2014, SFV set up Salesforce1 Fund, aimed at start-ups creating applications primarily for mobile phones. [ 170 ] In December 2018, Salesforce Ventures announced the launch of the Japan Trailblazer Fund, focused on Japanese startups. [ 171 ] In August 2018, Salesforce Ventures reported investments totaling over $1 billion in 275 companies, including CloudCraze (e-commerce), [ 172 ] Figure Eight ( artificial intelligence ), [ 173 ] Forter (online fraud prevention), [ 174 ] and FinancialForce (automation software). [ 175 ] In 2019, SFV's five largest investments— Domo (data-visualization software), SurveyMonkey (online survey software), Twilio (cloud-communication), Dropbox (cloud storage), and DocuSign (secure e-signature company)—accounted for nearly half of its portfolio. [ 176 ] In 2021, Salesforce announced that its investments had resulted in a $2.17 billion annual gain. [ 177 ] In June 2023, Salesforce increased the size of its Generative AI Fund for startups from $250 million to $500 million, [ 178 ] and in September 2024 to $1 billion. [ 179 ] To date, Salesforce Ventures has invested $5 billion in companies based in 27 different countries.

In an official post on the company's website, it was stated that \"the board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI\". [ 1 ] The removal was predicated by employee concerns about his handling of artificial intelligence safety , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and allegations of abusive behavior. [ 4 ] Altman was reinstated on November 22 after pressure from employees and investors. [ 5 ] The removal and subsequent reinstatement caused widespread reactions, including impacts felt in the financial markets and technology sector. Microsoft, a partner of OpenAI, received little notice of the removal and experienced a drop in the share price of its stock. The removal also promoted interest in investigations from regulatory agencies. Background [ edit ] OpenAI [ edit ] Main article: OpenAI OpenAI is an artificial intelligence firm founded in December 2015 as a non-profit entity. [ 6 ] The for-profit division of the organization released ChatGPT in November 2022, [ 7 ] contributing to a resurgence in generative artificial intelligence funding. [ 8 ] The board of directors of the controlling non-profit formerly comprised chief scientist Ilya Sutskever , as well as Adam D'Angelo , chief executive of Quora , entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner , strategy director for the Center for Security and Emerging Technology . [ 9 ] As of October 2023, the company is valued at US$80 billion [ 10 ] and was set to bring in US$1 billion in revenue. [ 11 ] Altman has described OpenAI's relationship with Microsoft as the \"best bromance in tech\". [ 12 ] OpenAI is uniquely structured, [ 13 ] an intentional decision to avoid investor control. [ 14 ] A board of directors controls the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. The non-profit owns and controls a for-profit company itself controlling a capped-profit company, OpenAI Global, LLC and a holding company owned by employees and other investors. The holding company is the majority owner of OpenAI Global, LLC.; Microsoft owns a minority stake in the capped-profit company. [ 15 ] OpenAI's bylaws, enacted in January 2016, allow a majority of its board of directors to remove any director without prior warning or a formal meeting with written consent. [ 16 ] Sam Altman [ edit ] Main article: Sam Altman Sam Altman is a co-founder of OpenAI and its former chief executive; Altman took over the company following co-chair Elon Musk 's resignation in 2018. Under Altman, OpenAI has shifted to becoming a for-profit entity. [ 6 ] Altman is credited with convincing Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella with investing US$10 billion in cash and computing credits into OpenAI and leading several tender offer transactions that tripled the company's valuation. [ 17 ] Altman testified before the United States Congress speaking critically of artificial intelligence [ 18 ] and appeared at the 2023 AI Safety Summit . [ 19 ] In the days leading up to his removal, Altman made several public appearances, announcing the GPT-4 Turbo platform at OpenAI's DevDay conference, attending APEC United States 2023 , [ 7 ] and speaking at an event related to Burning Man . [ 20 ] Events leading up to the removal [ edit ] The resignation of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman , venture capitalist Shivon Zilis , and former Republican representative Will Hurd from the board allowed the remaining members to remove Altman. [ 16 ] According to Kara Swisher and The Wall Street Journal , [ 21 ] Sutskever was instrumental in Altman's removal. [ 22 ] Disagreements over the safety of artificial intelligence divided employees prior to Altman's removal. [ 23 ] The release of ChatGPT created divisions with OpenAI as a for-profit company without considerations for the safety of artificial intelligence and a non-profit cautious of artificial intelligence's capabilities; in a staff email sent in 2019 and obtained by The Atlantic , Altman referred to these divisions as \"tribes\". [ 24 ] Prior to his removal, Altman was seeking billions from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds to develop an artificial intelligence chip to compete with Nvidia and courted SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son to develop artificial intelligence hardware with former Apple designer Jony Ive . Sutskever and his allies opposed these efforts, viewing them as unjustly using the OpenAI name. Altman reduced Sutskever's role in October 2023, furthering divisions; Sutskever successfully appealed to several members of the board. [ 25 ] Swisher and The Verge reporter Alex Heath stated that opposition to Altman's profit-driven strategy culminated in the DevDay conference [ 26 ] in which Altman announced custom ChatGPT instances. [ 27 ] According to Axios , the removal was driven by growing discontent and distrust with Altman. [ 28 ] On November 22, 2023, reports emerged suggesting that Sam Altman's dismissal from OpenAI might be linked to his alleged mishandling of a significant breakthrough in the organization's secretive project codenamed Q* . According to sources within OpenAI, Q* is aimed at developing AI capabilities in logical and mathematical reasoning, and reportedly involves performing math on the level of grade-school students. [ 29 ] Concerns about Altman's response to this development, specifically regarding the potential safety implications of the discovery, were reportedly raised to the company's board shortly before his firing. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] A report from The Washington Post in December stated that OpenAI's board of directors were concerned over Altman's allegedly abusive behavior; the complaints were purportedly a major factor in his removal. [ 4 ] The Post previously reported that Altman's alleged pattern of deception and subversiveness that ostensibly resulted in his removal from Y Combinator ultimately resulted in the board's decision to remove him. [ 30 ] Removal [ edit ] Avatar of Sam Altman Sam Altman ( @sama ) tweeted: i loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. November 17, 2023 [ 31 ] On November 17, 2023, at approximately noon PST , [ 32 ] OpenAI's board of directors ousted Altman effective immediately following a \"deliberative review process\". The board concluded that Altman was not \"consistently candid in his communications\". [ 33 ] Altman was informed of his removal five to ten minutes before it occurred [ 34 ] on a Google Meet [ 35 ] while watching the Las Vegas Grand Prix . [ 36 ] Within thirty minutes, [ 37 ] Sutskever invited OpenAI chairman and president Greg Brockman to a Google Meet to inform him of Altman's removal. [ 32 ] According to an internal memo obtained by Axios , the removal was not due to \"malfeasance\", [ 38 ] and OpenAI chief executive Emmett Shear denied accusations that the removal was due to disagreements. [ 39 ] The board publicly announced Altman's removal thirty minutes later. [ 40 ] Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati was immediately appointed to interim chief executive officer. Hours after Altman's removal, Brockman resigned as chairman, [ 41 ] joined by director of research Jakub Pachocki and researchers Aleksander Mądry [ pl ] and Szymon Sidor. [ 42 ] During an all-hands meeting, Sutskever defended the ouster and denied accusations of a hostile takeover. [ 13 ] An OpenAI representative requested former board member Will Hurd 's presence. [ 43 ] Reinstatement [ edit ] Tiger Global Management and Sequoia Capital had attempted to reinstate Altman, according to The Information ; [ 44 ] Bloomberg News reported that Microsoft and Thrive Capital were seeking Altman's reinstatement. [ 45 ] On November 18, The Verge reported that OpenAI's board of directors discussed reinstating Altman. The board agreed in principle to resign and to allow Altman to return, but missed the deadline. [ 46 ] According to The Verge , Altman was ambivalent about returning and would seek significant changes to the company, [ 47 ] including replacing the board. [ 48 ] A list of directors had been prepared by investors in the event that the board steps down, and purportedly included former Salesforce executive Bret Taylor . [ 45 ] According to chief strategy officer Jason Kwon, OpenAI was optimistic it could return Altman, Brockman, and other employees. [ 49 ] On November 19, Altman and Brockman appeared at OpenAI's headquarters to negotiate, mediated by Nadella. According to Bloomberg News, Murati, Kwon, and chief operating officer Brad Lightcap were pushing for a new board of directors; it was required that the board absolve him of wrongdoing in order for Altman to be reinstated. Taylor was expected be a member of the new board [ 50 ] and Microsoft had also attempted to gain a seat. [ 51 ] The Wall Street Journal reported that Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky and businesswoman Laurene Powell Jobs were also considered. [ 52 ] Murati had intended to rehire Altman and Brockman, discussing the move with Adam D'Angelo . [ 53 ] The Verge reported that Altman intended to return to OpenAI with support from Sutskever. [ 54 ] The board chose to name former Twitch chief executive Emmett Shear as OpenAI's chief executive [ 55 ] instead of reinstating Altman. [ 52 ] Former GitHub chief executive Nat Friedman and Scale AI chief executive Alex Wang reportedly rejected executive offers from the board. [ 56 ] Anthropic chief executive Dario Amodei [ 57 ] refused to negotiate a deal that could have led to a merge of the two companies. [ 58 ] In response, Microsoft appointed Altman as the chief executive of an artificial intelligence research team, [ 59 ] joined by Brockman, Pachocki, Sidor, and Madry. [ 60 ] Shear expressed interest in commercializing OpenAI with the board's support [ 61 ] and stated his intentions to begin an investigation into Altman's removal. [ 62 ] Dozens of employees announced their resignations in response to Shear's accession. [ 5 ] The next day, a letter signed by 745 [ 63 ] of OpenAI's 770 employees threatened mass resignations if the board does not resign; among the signatories was board member Sutskever, who defected from the board and publicly apologized for his participation in the board's previous actions. [ 64 ] On November 21, The Verge reported that Altman was reinstated with Taylor, D'Angelo, and economist Lawrence Summers on an interim [ 65 ] board. [ 66 ] Taylor will chair the board. [ 67 ] As part of the compromise deal, Altman and Brockman will not reclaim seats on the board. Altman agreed to an internal investigation into his alleged conduct, [ 68 ] selecting two lawyers from WilmerHale to conduct the inquiry. [ 69 ] In March 2024, the investigation determined that Altman's behavior \"did not mandate removal\". Taylor announced that Altman would rejoin OpenAI's board of directors with former Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation chief executive Sue Desmond-Hellmann , former Sony Corporation general counsel Nicole Seligman , and Instacart chief executive Fidji Simo . [ 70 ] In May 2024, after OpenAI's non-disparagement agreements were exposed, Altman was accused of lying when claiming to have been unaware of the equity cancellation provision for departing employees that don't sign the agreement. [ 71 ] Also in May, former board member Helen Toner explained the board's rationale for firing Altman in November 2023. She stated that Altman had withheld information, for example about the release of ChatGPT and his ownership of OpenAI's startup fund. She said that Altman provided \"inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place\". She also alleged that two executives in OpenAI had reported to the board \"psychological abuse\" from Altman, and provided screenshots and documentation of \"lying and being manipulative in different situations\". She said that many employees feared retaliation if they didn't support Altman, and that he had already been fired from Loopt because of what the management team had called \"deceptive and chaotic behavior\". [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Aftermath [ edit ] OpenAI [ edit ] The removal left OpenAI in \"chaos\", according to The New York Times . [ 74 ] According to Bloomberg News, a significant number of OpenAI engineers threatened to resign if the board did not reconsider Altman's removal. [ 75 ] According to The Information , Altman's removal risked a share sale led by Thrive Capital valuing the company at US$86 billion. [ 76 ] A potential second tender offer for early-stage investors was also at risk. [ 77 ] The Information later reported that Thrive Capital's tender offer will continue after Altman's reinstatement. [ 78 ] OpenAI delayed the release of its online chatbot store as a result of Altman's removal. [ 79 ] Market effects [ edit ] Shares in Microsoft fell nearly three percent following the announcement. [ 80 ] According to CoinDesk , the value of Worldcoin , an iris biometric cryptocurrency co-founded by Altman, decreased twelve percent. [ 6 ] After hiring Altman, Microsoft's stock price rose over two percent to an all-time high. [ 81 ] Altman's removal benefited OpenAI's competitors, such as Anthropic , Quora, Hugging Face , Meta Platforms , and Google . [ 82 ] The Economist wrote that the removal could slow down the artificial intelligence industry as a whole. [ 83 ] Google DeepMind received an increase in applicants, according to The Information ; Cohere and Adept engaged in an active effort to hire OpenAI employees. [ 84 ] Several investors considered writing down their OpenAI investments to zero, impacting the company's ability to raise capital. [ 75 ] Over one hundred companies using OpenAI contacted Anthropic, according to The Information ; others reached out to Google Cloud , Cohere, and Microsoft Azure . [ 85 ] Potential venture [ edit ] According to The Information , Altman was planning a new artificial intelligence venture with Brockman, [ 86 ] among other OpenAI employees. [ 87 ] Sequoia Capital investor Alfred Lin and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla expressed interest in Altman's potential venture. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Legal action [ edit ] Multiple OpenAI investors are considering legal action. [ 90 ] On December 8, the Competition and Markets Authority announced it was beginning a preliminary investigation into Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI and its non-voting board observership. [ 91 ] Hours later, Bloomberg News reported that the Federal Trade Commission was separately examining the relationship. [ 92 ] In response, Microsoft stated that it does not hold a stake in OpenAI. [ 93 ] In February 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was reportedly investigating OpenAI over whether internal company communications made by Altman were used to mislead investors, while an investigation of Altman's statements that was opened by the Southern New York U.S. Attorney's Office opened the previous November was ongoing. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Reactions [ edit ] Sam Altman [ edit ] Altman quipped that the OpenAI board of directors should sue him should he \"start going off\". [ 96 ] Former co-chair Elon Musk stated the board should be transparent in its removal. [ 97 ] At the 2023 DealBook Summit, Musk called the turmoil \"troubling\" and that he had \"mixed feelings\" towards Altman. [ 98 ] Allies of Altman accused board members of staging a coup [ 13 ] and several OpenAI employees responded to a tweet Altman wrote with a heart emoji, intended to demonstrate employees who are prepared to leave. [ 99 ] Former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt wrote that Altman was a \"hero to [him]\" after his removal. [ 33 ] Technology industry [ edit ] Microsoft executives were informed of Altman's removal a minute before the announcement was made, according to Axios , [ 100 ] and investors were not given advance knowledge. Satya Nadella and chief technology officer Kevin Scott expressed confidence in OpenAI following his removal, [ 101 ] though Nadella was reportedly furious, according to Bloomberg News. [ 25 ] Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham referred to the board's members as \"misbehaving children\". [ 28 ] Third Point chief executive and Microsoft shareholder Daniel S. Loeb stated that OpenAI had \"stunningly poor governance\". [ 102 ] French digital transition minister Jean-Noël Barrot stated that Altman is \"welcome in France\". [ 103 ] Following the employee letter, Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff offered to employ OpenAI employees with matching salaries, [ 104 ] an offer extended by Microsoft. [ 105 ] Media analysis [ edit ] Wired editor-at-large Steven Levy compared the removal of Altman to the removal of Steve Jobs from Apple in 1985, [ 106 ] a comparison made by The New York Times . [ 107 ] Axios posed that the board could resign, returning OpenAI to Altman. [ 63 ] Writing for The New York Times , Ezra Klein noted the role of OpenAI's controlling non-profit in self-regulation. [ 108 ] Analyst Fred Havemeyer stated that Nadella \"pulled off a coup of his own\" in hiring Altman in The Washington Post . [ 109 ] Altman was named as Time ' s CEO of the Year for 2023, owing partially to his removal. [ 110 ] Other [ edit ] In October 2024, Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton declared that he was proud that Ilya Sutskever , a former student of his, was responsible for firing Altman. [ 111 ] The events surrounding the firing are the subject of an upcoming film , with Andrew Garfield set to play Altman and Yura Borisov to play Sutskever.

Neal [ 3 ] Yee Whye Teh [ 4 ] Ruslan Salakhutdinov [ 5 ] Ilya Sutskever [ 6 ] Alex Krizhevsky [ 7 ] Other notable students Yann LeCun Peter Dayan Max Welling Zoubin Ghahramani Alex Graves Website Official website Geoffrey Everest Hinton (born 6 December 1947) is a British-Canadian computer scientist , cognitive scientist , and cognitive psychologist known for his work on artificial neural networks , which earned him the title \"the Godfather of AI\". [ 8 ] Hinton is University Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto . From 2013 to 2023, he divided his time working for Google Brain and the University of Toronto before publicly announcing his departure from Google in May 2023, citing concerns about the many risks of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In 2017, he co-founded and became the chief scientific advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] With David Rumelhart and Ronald J. Williams , Hinton was co-author of a highly cited paper published in 1986 that popularised the backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks, [ 13 ] although they were not the first to propose the approach. [ 14 ] Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community. [ 20 ] The image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky [ 21 ] and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge 2012 [ 7 ] was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision. [ 22 ] Hinton received the 2018 Turing Award , together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun for their work on deep learning. [ 23 ] They are sometimes referred to as the \"Godfathers of Deep Learning\" [ 24 ] [ 25 ] and have continued to give public talks together. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] He was also awarded, along with John Hopfield , the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for \"foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks \". [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In May 2023, Hinton announced his resignation from Google to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of A.I.\" [ 30 ] He has voiced concerns about deliberate misuse by malicious actors , technological unemployment , and existential risk from artificial general intelligence . [ 31 ] He noted that establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI in order to avoid the worst outcomes. [ 32 ] After receiving the Nobel Prize, he called for urgent research into AI safety to figure out how to control AI systems smarter than humans . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Education [ edit ] Hinton was born on 6 December 1947 [ 36 ] in Wimbledon , England, and was educated at Clifton College in Bristol. [ 37 ] In 1967, he matriculated as an undergraduate student at King's College, Cambridge , and after repeatedly switching between different fields, like natural sciences , history of art , and philosophy , eventually graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in 1970. [ 36 ] [ 38 ] He spent a year apprenticing carpentry before returning to academic studies. [ 39 ] From 1972 to 1975, he continued his study at the University of Edinburgh , where he was awarded a PhD in artificial intelligence in 1978 for research supervised by Christopher Longuet-Higgins , who favored the symbolic AI approach over the neural network approach. [ 38 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 39 ] Career [ edit ] After his PhD, Hinton initially worked at the University of Sussex and at the MRC Applied Psychology Unit . After having difficulty getting funding in Britain, [ 39 ] he worked in the US at the University of California, San Diego and Carnegie Mellon University . [ 36 ] He was the founding director of the Gatsby Charitable Foundation Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London . [ 36 ] He is currently [update] [ 42 ] University Professor Emeritus in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto , where he has been affiliated since 1987. [ 43 ] Upon arrival in Canada, Geoffrey Hinton was appointed at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) in 1987 as a Fellow in CIFAR's first research program, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics & Society. [ 44 ] In 2004, Hinton and collaborators successfully proposed the launch of a new program at CIFAR, \"Neural Computation and Adaptive Perception\" [ 45 ] (NCAP), which today is named \"Learning in Machines & Brains\". Hinton would go on to lead NCAP for ten years. [ 46 ] Among the members of the program are Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun , with whom Hinton would go on to win the ACM A.M. Turing Award in 2018. [ 47 ] All three Turing winners continue to be members of the CIFAR Learning in Machines & Brains program. [ 48 ] Hinton taught a free online course on Neural Networks on the education platform Coursera in 2012. [ 49 ] He co-founded DNNresearch Inc. in 2012 with his two graduate students, Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever, at the University of Toronto's department of computer science. In March 2013, Google acquired DNNresearch Inc. for $44 million, and Hinton planned to \"divide his time between his university research and his work at Google\". [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] In May 2023, Hinton publicly announced his resignation from Google. He explained his decision, saying he wanted to \"freely speak out about the risks of A.I.\" and added that part of him now regrets his life's work. [ 9 ] [ 30 ] Notable former PhD students and postdoctoral researchers from his group include Peter Dayan , [ 53 ] Sam Roweis, [ 53 ] Max Welling , [ 53 ] Richard Zemel , [ 40 ] [ 1 ] Brendan Frey , [ 2 ] Radford M. Neal , [ 3 ] Yee Whye Teh , [ 4 ] Ruslan Salakhutdinov , [ 5 ] Ilya Sutskever , [ 6 ] Yann LeCun , [ 54 ] Alex Graves , [ 53 ] Zoubin Ghahramani , [ 53 ] and Peter Fitzhugh Brown . [ 55 ] Research [ edit ] Hinton's research concerns the use of neural networks for machine learning , memory , perception , and symbol processing. He has written or co-written more than 200 peer-reviewed publications. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] In the 1980s, Hinton was part of the \"Parallel Distributed Processing\" group at Carnegie Mellon University, which included notable scientists like Terrence Sejnowski , Francis Crick , David Rumelhart , and James McClelland . This group favoured the connectionist approach during the AI winter . Their findings were published in a two-volume set. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] The connectionist approach adopted by Hinton suggests that capabilities in areas like logic and grammar can be encoded into the parameters of neural networks, and that neural networks can learn them from data. Symbolists on the other side advocated for explicitly programming knowledge and rules into AI systems. [ 8 ] In 1985, Hinton co-invented Boltzmann machines with David Ackley and Terry Sejnowski. [ 60 ] His other contributions to neural network research include distributed representations , time delay neural network , mixtures of experts , Helmholtz machines and product of experts . [ 61 ] An accessible introduction to Geoffrey Hinton's research can be found in his articles in Scientific American in September 1992 and October 1993. [ 62 ] In 1995, Hinton and colleagues proposed the wake-sleep algorithm, involving a neural network with separate pathways for recognition and generation, being trained with alternating \"wake\" and \"sleep\" phases. [ 63 ] In 2007, Hinton coauthored an unsupervised learning paper titled Unsupervised learning of image transformations . [ 64 ] In 2008, he developed the visualization method t-SNE with Laurens van der Maaten. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] In 2016, from left to right, Russ Salakhutdinov , Richard S. Sutton , Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio , and Steve Jurvetson While Hinton was a postdoc at UC San Diego, David Rumelhart, Hinton and Ronald J. Williams applied the backpropagation algorithm to multi-layer neural networks. Their experiments showed that such networks can learn useful internal representations of data. [ 13 ] In a 2018 interview, [ 67 ] Hinton said that \"David Rumelhart came up with the basic idea of backpropagation, so it's his invention\". Although this work was important in popularising backpropagation, it was not the first to suggest the approach. [ 14 ] Reverse-mode automatic differentiation , of which backpropagation is a special case, was proposed by Seppo Linnainmaa in 1970, and Paul Werbos proposed to use it to train neural networks in 1974. [ 14 ] In 2017, Hinton co-authored two open-access research papers about capsule neural networks , extending the concept of \"capsule\" introduced by Hinton in 2011. The architecture aims to better model part-whole relationships within objects in visual data. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] In 2021, Hinton presented GLOM, a speculative architecture idea also aiming to improve image understanding by modeling part-whole relationships in neural networks. [ 70 ] In 2021, Hinton co-authored a widely cited paper proposing a framework for contrastive learning in computer vision. [ 71 ] The technique involves pulling together representations of augmented versions of the same image, and pushing apart dissimilar representations. [ 71 ] At the 2022 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), Hinton introduced a new learning algorithm for neural networks that he calls the \"Forward-Forward\" algorithm. The idea is to replace the traditional forward-backwards passes of backpropagation with two forward passes, one with positive (i.e. real) data and the other with negative data that could be generated solely by the network. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] The Forward-Forward algorithm is well-suited for what Hinton calls \"mortal computation\", where the knowledge learned isn't transferable to other systems and thus dies with the hardware, as can be the case for certain analog computers used for machine learning. [ 74 ] [ 8 ] Honours and awards [ edit ] Hinton is a Fellow of the US Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (FAAAI) since 1990. [ 75 ] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (FRSC) in 1996, [ 76 ] and then a Fellow of the Royal Society of London (FRS) in 1998 . [ 77 ] He was the first winner of the Rumelhart Prize in 2001. [ 78 ] According to the Royal Society: Geoffrey Hinton is distinguished for his work on artificial neural nets, especially how they can be designed to learn without the aid of a human teacher. This may well be the start of autonomous intelligent brain-like machines. He has compared effects of brain damage with effects of losses in such a net, and found striking similarities with human impairment, such as for recognition of names and losses of categorisation. His work includes studies of mental imagery, and inventing puzzles for testing originality and creative intelligence. [ 79 ] In 2001, Hinton was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science (DSc) degree from the University of Edinburgh . [ 38 ] [ 80 ] He was awarded as International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003. [ 81 ] Also, in this year he was elected a Fellow of the US Cognitive Science Society . [ 82 ] He was the 2005 recipient of the IJCAI Award for Research Excellence lifetime-achievement award. [ 83 ] He was awarded the 2011 Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering . [ 84 ] In that same year, he also was awarded an honorary DSc degree from the University of Sussex [ 38 ] In 2012, he received the Canada Council Killam Prize in Engineering. In 2013, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Université de Sherbrooke . [ 38 ] [ 85 ] Hinton was elected an Honorary Foreign Member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Engineering in 2015. [ 38 ] Hinton at NeurIPS 2025 In 2016, Hinton was elected an International Member of the US National Academy of Engineering \"for contributions to the theory and practice of artificial neural networks and their application to speech recognition and computer vision\". [ 86 ] [ 87 ] He received the 2016 IEEE/RSE Wolfson James Clerk Maxwell Award . [ 88 ] In 2016, he furthermore won the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Information and Communication Technologies category, \"for his pioneering and highly influential work\" to endow machines with the ability to learn. [ 89 ] Together with Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio , Hinton won the 2018 Turing Award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] Also in 2018, he became a Companion of the Order of Canada (CC). [ 93 ] In 2021, he received the Dickson Prize in Science from the Carnegie Mellon University [ 94 ] and in 2022 the Princess of Asturias Award in the Scientific Research category, along with Yann LeCun , Yoshua Bengio , and Demis Hassabis . [ 95 ] In the same year, Hinton received an Honorary DSc degree from the University of Toronto . [ 38 ] In 2023, he was named an ACM Fellow , [ 96 ] elected an International Member of the US National Academy of Sciences , [ 97 ] and received Lifeboat Foundation 's 2023 Guardian Award along with Ilya Sutskever. [ 98 ] In 2024, he was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics with John Hopfield \"for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.\" [ 99 ] His development of the Boltzmann machine was explicitly mentioned in the citation. [ 28 ] [ 100 ] When the New York Times reporter Cade Metz asked Hinton to explain in simpler terms how the Boltzmann machine could \"pretrain\" backpropagation networks, Hinton quipped that Richard Feynman reportedly said: \"Listen, buddy, if I could explain it in a couple of minutes, it wouldn't be worth the Nobel Prize.\" [ 101 ] That same year, he received the VinFuture Prize grand award alongside Yoshua Bengio , Yann LeCun , Jen-Hsun Huang , and Fei-Fei Li for groundbreaking contributions to neural networks and deep learning algorithms. [ 102 ] German AI researcher Jürgen Schmidhuber contended that Hinton and others in the field did not appropriately credit existing research, and argued that foundational work by Paul Werbos and Shun-Ichi Amari in the 1970s on backpropagation and neural networks was insufficiently acknowledged. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] In 2025 he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering jointly with Yoshua Bengio , Bill Dally , John Hopfield , Yann LeCun , Jen-Hsun Huang and Fei-Fei Li . [ 105 ] [ 106 ] He was also awarded the King Charles III Coronation Medal . [ 107 ] Views [ edit ] Risks of artificial intelligence [ edit ] See also: AI safety External videos Geoffrey Hinton shares his thoughts on AI's benefits and dangers , 60 Minutes YouTube video In 2023, Hinton expressed concerns about the rapid progress of AI . [ 31 ] [ 30 ] He had previously believed that artificial general intelligence (AGI) was \"30 to 50 years or even longer away.\" [ 30 ] However, in a March 2023 interview with CBS , he said that \"general-purpose AI\" might be fewer than 20 years away and could bring about changes \"comparable in scale with the industrial revolution or electricity .\" [ 31 ] In an interview with The New York Times published on 1 May 2023, [ 30 ] Hinton announced his resignation from Google so he could \"talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google.\" [ 108 ] He noted that \"a part of him now regrets his life's work\". [ 30 ] [ 10 ] In early May 2023, Hinton said in an interview with the BBC that AI might soon surpass the information capacity of the human brain. He described some of the risks posed by these chatbots as \"quite scary\". Hinton explained that chatbots can learn independently and share knowledge, so that whenever one copy acquires new information, it is automatically disseminated to the entire group, allowing AI chatbots to accumulate knowledge far beyond the capacity of any individual. [ 109 ] In 2025, he said \"My greatest fear is that, in the long run, it'll turn out that these kind of digital beings we're creating are just a better form of intelligence than people. […] We'd no longer be needed. […] If you want to know how it's like not to be the apex intelligence, ask a chicken. [ 110 ] Existential risk from AGI [ edit ] Hinton has expressed concerns about the possibility of an AI takeover , stating that \"it's not inconceivable\" that AI could \"wipe out humanity\" . [ 31 ] Hinton said in 2023 that AI systems capable of intelligent agency would be useful for military or economic purposes. [ 111 ] He worries that generally intelligent AI systems could \"create sub-goals\" that are unaligned with their programmers' interests. [ 112 ] He says that AI systems may become power-seeking or prevent themselves from being shut off, not because programmers intended them to, but because those sub-goals are useful for achieving later goals . [ 109 ] In particular, Hinton says \"we have to think hard about how to control\" AI systems capable of self-improvement . [ 113 ] Catastrophic misuse [ edit ] Hinton reports concerns about deliberate misuse of AI by malicious actors, stating that \"it is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using [AI] for bad things.\" [ 30 ] In 2017, Hinton called for an international ban on lethal autonomous weapons . [ 114 ] In 2025, in an interview, Hinton cited the use of AI by bad actors to create lethal viruses one of the greatest existential threats posed in the short term. \"It just requires one crazy guy with a grudge...you can now create new viruses relatively cheaply using AI. And you don't need to be a very skilled molecular biologist to do it.\" [ 115 ] Economic impacts [ edit ] Hinton was previously optimistic about the economic effects of AI, noting in 2018 that: \"The phrase 'artificial general intelligence' carries with it the implication that this sort of single robot is suddenly going to be smarter than you. I don't think it's going to be that. I think more and more of the routine things we do are going to be replaced by AI systems.\" [ 116 ] Hinton had also argued that AGI would not make humans redundant: \"[AI in the future is] going to know a lot about what you're probably going to want to do... But it's not going to replace you.\" [ 116 ] In 2023, however, Hinton became \"worried that AI technologies will in time upend the job market\" and take away more than just \"drudge work\" . [ 30 ] He said in 2024 that the British government would have to establish a universal basic income to deal with the impact of AI on inequality. [ 117 ] In Hinton's view, AI will boost productivity and generate more wealth. But unless the government intervenes, it will only make the rich richer and hurt the people who might lose their jobs. \"That's going to be very bad for society,\" he said. [ 118 ] At Christmas 2024, he had become somewhat more pessimistic, saying there was a \"10 to 20 per cent chance\" that AI would cause human extinction within the next three decades (he had previously suggested a 10% chance, without a timescale). [ 119 ] He expressed surprise at the speed with which AI was advancing, and said that most experts expected AI to advance, probably in the next 20 years, to be \"smarter than people ... a scary thought. ... So just leaving it to the profit motive of large companies is not going to be sufficient to make sure they develop it safely. The only thing that can force those big companies to do more research on safety is government regulation.\" [ 119 ] Another \"godfather of AI\", Yann LeCun , disagreed, saying AI \"could actually save humanity from extinction\". [ 119 ] Politics [ edit ] Hinton is a socialist . [ 120 ] He moved from the US to Canada in part due to disillusionment with Ronald Reagan –era politics and disapproval of military funding of artificial intelligence. [ 39 ] In August 2024, Hinton co-authored a letter with Yoshua Bengio , Stuart Russell , and Lawrence Lessig in support of SB 1047 , a California AI safety bill that would require companies training models which cost more than US$100 million to perform risk assessments before deployment. They said the legislation was the \"bare minimum for effective regulation of this technology.\" [ 121 ] [ 122 ] Personal life [ edit ] Hinton's first wife, Rosalind Zalin, died of ovarian cancer in 1994; his second wife, Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Ford, died of pancreatic cancer in 2018. [ 8 ] [ 123 ] Hinton is the great-great-grandson of the mathematician and educator Mary Everest Boole and her husband, the logician George Boole . [ 124 ] George Boole's work eventually became one of the foundations of modern computer science. Another great-great-grandfather of his was the surgeon and author James Hinton , [ 125 ] who was the father of the mathematician Charles Howard Hinton . Hinton's father was the entomologist Howard Hinton . [ 36 ] [ 126 ] His middle name comes from another relative, George Everest , the Surveyor General of India after whom the mountain is named. [ 39 ] He is the nephew of the economist Colin Clark , [ 127 ] and nuclear physicist Joan Hinton , one of the two female physicists at the Manhattan Project , was his first cousin once removed. [ 128 ] Hinton injured his back at age 19, which makes sitting painful for him. He has dealt with depression throughout his life.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Founded by Elon Musk in 2023, the company's flagship products are the generative AI chatbot named Grok and the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) , the latter of which they acquired in March 2025. History [ edit ] xAI was founded on March 9, 2023, by Musk. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] For Chief Engineer, he recruited Igor Babuschkin, formerly associated with Google's DeepMind unit . [ 12 ] Musk officially announced the formation of xAI on July 12, 2023. [ 13 ] As of July 2023, xAI was headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area . [ 14 ] It was initially incorporated in Nevada as a public-benefit corporation with the stated general purpose of \"creat[ing] a material positive impact on society and the environment\". [ 15 ] By May 2024, it had dropped the public-benefit status. [ 16 ] The original stated goal of the company was \"to understand the true nature of the universe\". [ 17 ] Financial history [ edit ] In November 2023, Musk stated that \"X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI\". [ 18 ] In December 2023, in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission , xAI revealed that it had raised US$134.7 million in outside funding out of a total of up to $1 billion. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] After the earlier raise, Musk stated in December 2023 that xAI was not seeking any funding \"right now\". [ 21 ] By May 2024, xAI was reportedly planning to raise another $6 billion of funding. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Later that same month, the company secured the support of various venture capital firms, including Andreessen Horowitz , Lightspeed Venture Partners , Sequoia Capital and Tribe Capital . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] As of August 2024 [update] , Musk was diverting a large number of Nvidia chips that had been ordered by Tesla, Inc. to X and xAI. [ 26 ] On December 23, 2024, xAI raised an additional $6 billion in a private funding round supported by Fidelity , BlackRock , Sequoia Capital , among others, making its total funding to date over $12 billion. [ 27 ] On February 10, 2025, xAI and other investors made an offer to acquire OpenAI for $97.4 billion. [ 28 ] On March 17, 2025, xAI acquired Hotshot, a startup working on AI-powered video generation tools . [ 29 ] On March 28, 2025, Musk announced that xAI acquired sister company X Corp. , the developer of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) , which was previously acquired by Musk in October 2022. The deal, an all-stock transaction, valued X at $33 billion, with a full valuation of $45 billion when factoring in $12 billion in debt. Meanwhile, xAI itself was valued at $80 billion. Both companies were combined into a single entity called X.AI Holdings Corp. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] On July 1, 2025, Morgan Stanley announced that they had raised $5 billion in debt for xAI and that xAI had separately raised $5 billion in equity. The debt consists of secured notes and term loans. Morgan Stanley took no stake in the debt. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] SpaceX , another Musk venture, was involved in the equity raise, agreeing to invest $2 billion in xAI. [ 35 ] On July 14, xAI announced \"Grok for Government\" and the United States Department of Defense announced that xAI had received a $200 million contract for AI in the military, along with Anthropic , Google , and OpenAI. [ 36 ] On September 12, xAI laid off 500 data annotation workers. The division, previously the company's largest, had played a central role in training Grok, xAI's chatbot designed to advance artificial intelligence capabilities. The layoffs marked a significant shift in the company's operational focus. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] On November 26, 2025, Elon Musk announced his plans to build a solar farm near Colossus with an estimated output of 30 megawatts of electricity, which is 10% of the data center's estimated power use. The Southern Environmental Law Center has stated the current gas turbines produce about 2,000 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions annually. [ 40 ] Environmental impact [ edit ] In June 2024, the Greater Memphis Chamber announced xAI was planning on building Colossus , the world's largest supercomputer, in Memphis, Tennessee . [ 41 ] After a 122-day construction, the supercomputer went fully operational in December 2024. Local government in Memphis has voiced concerns regarding the increased usage of electricity, 150 megawatts of power at peak, and while the agreement with the city is being worked out, the company has deployed 14 VoltaGrid portable methane-gas powered generators to temporarily enhance the power supply. [ 42 ] Environmental advocates said that the gas-burning turbines emit large quantities of gases causing air pollution, and that xAI has been operating the turbines illegally without the necessary permits. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] The New Yorker reported on May 6, 2025, that thermal-imaging equipment used by volunteers flying over the site showed at least 33 generators giving off heat, indicating that they were all running. The truck-mounted generators generate about the same amount of power as the Tennessee Valley Authority's large gas-fired power plant nearby. [ 45 ] The Shelby County Health Department granted xAI an air permit for the project in July 2025. [ 46 ] Expansion and merger [ edit ] xAI has continually expanded its infrastructure, with the purchase of a third building on December 30, 2025 to boost its training capacity to nearly 2 gigawatts of compute power. xAI's commitment to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude models underlies the expansion. Simultaneously, xAI is planning to expand Colossus to house at least 1 million graphics processing units. [ 47 ] On February 2, 2026, SpaceX acquired xAI in an all-stock transaction that structured xAI as a wholly owned subsidiary of SpaceX. [ 9 ] [ 48 ] The acquisition valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion, for a combined total of $1.25 trillion. [ 49 ] On February 11, 2026, xAI was restructured following the SpaceX acquisition, leading to some layoffs, the restructure reorganises xAI into four primary development teams, one for the Grok app and others for its other features such as Grok Imagine. Grokipedia, X and API features would fall under more minor teams. [ 50 ] Products [ edit ] According to Musk in July 2023, a politically correct AI would be \"incredibly dangerous\" and misleading, citing as an example the fictional HAL 9000 from the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey . Musk instead said that xAI would be \"maximally truth-seeking\". Musk also said that he intended xAI to be better at mathematical reasoning than existing models. [ 51 ] On November 4, 2023, xAI unveiled Grok , an AI chatbot that is integrated with X . xAI stated that when the bot is out of beta , it will only be available to X's Premium+ subscribers. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] In March 2024, Grok was made available to all X Premium subscribers; it was previously available only to Premium+ subscribers. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] On March 17, 2024, xAI released Grok-1 as open source . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] On March 29, 2024, Grok-1.5 was announced, with \"improved reasoning capabilities\" and a context length of 128,000 tokens. [ 58 ] On April 12, 2024, Grok-1.5 Vision (Grok-1.5V) was announced. [ 59 ] [ non-primary source needed ] On August 14, 2024, Grok-2 was made available to X Premium subscribers. [ 60 ] It is the first Grok model with image generation capabilities. [ 61 ] On October 21, 2024, xAI released an applications programming interface (API). [ 62 ] On December 9, 2024, xAI released a text-to-image model named Aurora . [ 63 ] On February 17, 2025, xAI released Grok-3, which includes a reflection feature. xAI also introduced a websearch function called DeepSearch. [ 64 ] In March 2025, xAI added an image editing feature to Grok, enabling users to upload a photo, describe the desired changes, and receive a modified version. [ 65 ] Alongside this, xAI released DeeperSearch, an enhanced version of DeepSearch. [ 66 ] On July 9, 2025, xAI unveiled Grok-4. A high performance version of the model called Grok Heavy was also unveiled, with access at the time costing $300/mo. [ 67 ] On October 27, 2025, xAI launched Grokipedia , an AI-powered online encyclopedia and alternative to Wikipedia , developed by the company and powered by Grok. [ 68 ] Also in October, Musk announced that xAI had established a dedicated game studio to develop AI-driven video games, with plans to release a great AI-generated game before the end of 2026.

Participate Now [Help with translations!] From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Artificial intelligence scenario An AI takeover is a fictional or hypothetical future event in which autonomous artificial intelligence systems acquire the capability to override human decision-making. This could be achieved through economic manipulation, infrastructure control, or direct intervention, resulting in de facto governance. Scenarios range from economic dominance by way of the replacement of the entire human workforce due to automation to the violent takeover of the world by a robot uprising or rogue AI . Stories of AI takeovers have been popular throughout science fiction . Commentators argue that recent advancements in the field have heightened concern about such scenarios. In public debate, prominent figures such as Stephen Hawking have advocated research into precautionary measures to ensure future superintelligent machines remain under human control. [ 1 ] Types [ edit ] Automation of the economy [ edit ] Main article: Technological unemployment The traditional consensus among economists has been that technological progress does not cause long-term unemployment. However, recent innovation in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence has raised worries that human labor will become obsolete, leaving some people in various sectors without jobs to earn a living, leading to an economic crisis. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Many small and medium-size businesses may also be driven out of business if they cannot afford or license the latest robotic and AI technology, and may need to focus on areas or services that cannot easily be replaced for continued viability in the face of such technology. [ 6 ] Technologies that may displace workers [ edit ] AI technologies have been widely adopted in recent years. AI has been tested and used to assist and sometimes replace people in medical diagnosing, public administration procedures, car driving, job selection procedures, military operations, and management of work activities via digital platforms such as Uber and others. [ 7 ] While these technologies have replaced some traditional workers, they also create new opportunities. Industries that are most susceptible to AI-driven automation include transportation, retail, and the military. AI military technologies, for example, can reduce risk by enabling remote operation. A study in 2024 highlights AI's ability to perform routine and repetitive tasks poses significant risks of job displacement, especially in sectors like manufacturing and administrative support. [ 8 ] Author Dave Bond argues that as AI technologies continue to develop and expand, the relationship between humans and robots will change; they will become closely integrated in several aspects of life. AI will likely displace some workers while creating opportunities for new jobs in other sectors, especially in fields where tasks are repeatable. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] AI is set to transform the global workforce by 2050, according to reports from PwC, McKinsey, and the World Economic Forum. [ 11 ] Researchers from Stanford's Digital Economy Lab [ 12 ] report that, since the widespread adoption of generative AI in late 2022, early-career workers (ages 22–25) in the most AI-exposed occupations have experienced a 13 percent relative decline in employment—even after controlling for firm-level shocks—while overall employment has continued to grow robustly. [ 13 ] The study further finds that job losses are concentrated in roles where AI automates routine tasks, whereas occupations that leverage AI to augment human work have seen stable or increasing employment. [ 14 ] Computer-integrated manufacturing [ edit ] See also: Artificial intelligence in industry Computer-integrated manufacturing uses computers to control the production process. This allows individual processes to exchange information with each other and initiate actions. Although manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone through the integration of computers, the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes. Computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive, aviation, space, and shipbuilding industries. White-collar machines [ edit ] See also: White-collar worker The 21st century has seen a variety of skilled tasks partially taken over by machines, including translation, legal research, and journalism. Care work, entertainment, and other tasks requiring empathy, previously thought safe from automation, are increasingly performed by robots and AI systems. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Autonomous cars [ edit ] An autonomous car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Many such vehicles are operational and others are being developed, with legislation rapidly expanding to allow their use. Obstacles to widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles have included concerns about the resulting loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry, and safety concerns. On March 18, 2018, a pedestrian was struck and killed in Tempe, Arizona by an Uber self-driving car. [ 19 ] AI-generated content [ edit ] See also: Artificial intelligence art In the 2020s, automated content became more relevant due to technological advancements in AI models, such as ChatGPT , DALL-E , and Stable Diffusion . In most cases, AI-generated content such as imagery, literature, and music are produced through text prompts. These AI models are sometimes integrated into creative programs. AI-generated art may sample and conglomerate existing creative works, producing results that appear similar to human-made content. Low-quality AI-generated visual artwork is referred to as AI slop . Some artists use a tool called Nightshade that alters images to make them detrimental to the training of text-to-image models if scraped without permission, while still looking normal to humans. [ 20 ] AI-generated images are a potential tool for scammers and those looking to gain followers on social media, either to impersonate a famous individual or group or to monetize their audience. [ 21 ] The New York Times has sued OpenAI , alleging copyright infringement related to the training and outputs of its AI models. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] In 2024, Cambridge and Oxford researchers reported that 57% of the internet's text is either AI-generated or machine-translated using artificial intelligence. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Eradication [ edit ] Main article: Existential risk from artificial general intelligence Scientists such as Stephen Hawking are confident that superhuman artificial intelligence is physically possible, stating \"there is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains\". [ 29 ] [ 30 ] According to Nick Bostrom , a superintelligent machine would not necessarily be motivated by the same emotional desire to collect power that often drives human beings but might rather treat power as a means toward attaining its ultimate goals; taking over the world would both increase its access to resources and help to prevent other agents from stopping the machine's plans. As a simplified example, a paperclip maximizer designed solely to create as many paperclips as possible would want to take over the world so that it can use all of the world's resources to create as many paperclips as possible, and, additionally, prevent humans from shutting it down or using those resources on things other than paperclips. [ 31 ] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos survey showed that 61% of American adults feared AI could pose a threat to civilization. Philosopher Niels Wilde refutes the common thread that artificial intelligence inherently presents a looming threat to humanity, stating that these fears stem from perceived intelligence and lack of transparency in AI systems that more closely reflects the human aspects of it rather than those of a machine. [ 32 ] AI alignment research studies how to design AI systems so that they follow intended objectives. [ 33 ] Warnings [ edit ] Physicist Stephen Hawking, Microsoft founder Bill Gates , and SpaceX founder Elon Musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could develop to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could \"spell the end of the human race\". [ 34 ] Stephen Hawking said in 2014 that \"Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.\" Hawking believed that in the coming decades, AI could offer \"incalculable benefits and risks\" such as \"technology outsmarting financial markets , out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand.\" In January 2015, Nick Bostrom joined Stephen Hawking, Max Tegmark , Elon Musk, Lord Martin Rees , Jaan Tallinn , and numerous AI researchers in signing the Future of Life Institute 's open letter speaking to the potential risks and benefits associated with artificial intelligence . The signatories \"believe that research on how to make AI systems robust and beneficial is both important and timely, and that there are concrete research directions that can be pursued today.\" [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Some focus has been placed on the development of trustworthy AI . Three statements have been posed as to why AI is not inherently trustworthy: [ 37 ] 1. An entity X is trustworthy only if X has the right motivations, goodwill and/or adheres to moral obligations towards the trustor; 2. AI systems lack motivations, goodwill, and moral obligations; 3. Therefore, AI systems cannot be trustworthy. — Giacomo Zanotti et al. There are additional considerations within this framework of trustworthy AI that go further into the fields of explainable artificial intelligence and respect for human privacy. [ 38 ] Zanotti and colleagues argue that while a trustworthy AI may not exist at present that meets all of the requirements of \"trustworthiness\", one may be developed in the future once clear ethical and technical frameworks exist. [ 37 ] In fiction [ edit ] Main article: AI takeovers in popular culture See also: Artificial intelligence in fiction and Self-replicating machines in fiction Robots revolt in R.U.R. , a 1928 Czech play translated as \"Rossum's Universal Robots\" AI takeover is a recurring theme in science fiction . Fictional scenarios typically differ vastly from those hypothesized by researchers in that they involve an active conflict between humans and an AI or robots with anthropomorphic motives who see them as a threat or otherwise have an active desire to fight humans, as opposed to the researchers' concern of an AI that rapidly exterminates humans as a byproduct of pursuing its goals. [ 39 ] The idea is seen in Karel Čapek 's R.U.R. , which introduced the word robot in 1920, [ 40 ] and can be glimpsed in Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein (published in 1818), as Victor ponders whether, if he grants his monster's request and makes him a wife, they would reproduce and their kind would destroy humanity. [ 41 ] According to Toby Ord , the idea that an AI takeover requires robots is a misconception driven by the media and Hollywood. He argues that the most damaging humans in history were not physically the strongest, but that they used words instead to convince people and gain control of large parts of the world. He writes that a sufficiently intelligent AI with access to the internet could scatter backup copies of itself, gather financial and human resources (via cyberattacks or blackmails), persuade people on a large scale, and exploit societal vulnerabilities that are too subtle for humans to anticipate. [ 42 ] The word \"robot\" from R.U.R. comes from the Czech word robota , meaning laborer or serf . The 1920 play was a protest against the rapid growth of technology, featuring manufactured \"robots\" with increasing capabilities who eventually revolt. [ 43 ] HAL 9000 (1968) and the original Terminator (1984) are two iconic examples of hostile AI in pop culture. [ 44 ] Contributing factors [ edit ] Advantages of superhuman intelligence over humans [ edit ] Nick Bostrom and others have expressed concern that an AI with the abilities of a competent artificial intelligence researcher would be able to modify its own source code and increase its own intelligence. If its self-reprogramming leads to getting even better at being able to reprogram itself, the result could be a recursive intelligence explosion in which it would rapidly leave human intelligence far behind. Bostrom defines a superintelligence as \"any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest\", and enumerates some advantages a superintelligence would have if it chose to compete against humans: [ 39 ] [ 45 ] Technology research: A machine with superhuman scientific research abilities would be able to beat the human research community to milestones such as nanotechnology or advanced biotechnology Strategizing : A superintelligence might be able to simply outwit human opposition Social manipulation: A superintelligence might be able to recruit human support, [ 39 ] or covertly incite a war between humans [ 46 ] Economic productivity: As long as a copy of the AI could produce more economic wealth than the cost of its hardware, individual humans would have an incentive to voluntarily allow the artificial general intelligence (AGI) to run a copy of itself on their systems Hacking: A superintelligence could find new exploits in computers connected to the Internet, and spread copies of itself onto those systems, or might steal money to finance its plans Sources of AI advantage [ edit ] According to Bostrom, a computer program that faithfully emulates a human brain, or that runs algorithms that are as powerful as the human brain's algorithms, could still become a \"speed superintelligence\" if it can think orders of magnitude faster than a human, due to being made of silicon rather than flesh, or due to optimization increasing the speed of the AGI. Biological neurons operate at about 200 Hz, whereas a modern microprocessor operates at a speed of about 2 GHz. Human axons carry action potentials at around 120 m/s, whereas computer signals travel near the speed of light. [ 39 ] A network of human-level intelligences designed to network together and share complex thoughts and memories seamlessly, able to collectively work as a giant unified team without friction, or consisting of trillions of human-level intelligences, would become a \"collective superintelligence\". [ 39 ] More broadly, any number of qualitative improvements to a human-level AGI could result in a \"quality superintelligence\", perhaps resulting in an AGI as far above us in intelligence as humans are above apes. The number of neurons in a human brain is limited by cranial volume and metabolic constraints, while the number of processors in a supercomputer can be indefinitely expanded. An AGI need not be limited by human constraints on working memory , and might therefore be able to intuitively grasp more complex relationships than humans can. An AGI with specialized cognitive support for engineering or computer programming would have an advantage in these fields, compared with humans who did not evolve specialized cognitive modules for them. Unlike humans, an AGI can spawn copies of itself and tinker with its copies' source code to attempt to further improve its algorithms. [ 39 ] Possibility of unfriendly AI preceding friendly AI [ edit ] Morality [ edit ] Main article: AI alignment The sheer complexity of human value systems makes it very difficult to make AI's motivations human-friendly. [ 39 ] [ 47 ] Unless moral philosophy provides us with a flawless ethical theory, an AI's utility function could allow for many potentially harmful scenarios that conform with a given ethical framework but not \"common sense\". According to AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky , there is little reason to suppose that an artificially designed mind would have such an adaptation. [ 48 ] Odds of conflict [ edit ] Many scholars, including evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker , argue that a superintelligent machine is likely to coexist peacefully with humans. [ 49 ] The fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity's history, which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide. Such fears stem from a belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being's goal system. However, such human competitiveness stems from the evolutionary background to our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal. [ 50 ] According to AI researcher Steve Omohundro , an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals: there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine (not sharing humanity's evolutionary context) would be hostile—or friendly—unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of modifying its programming. But the question remains: what would happen if AI systems could interact and evolve (evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction) and need to compete over resources—would that create goals of self-preservation? AI's goal of self-preservation could be in conflict with some goals of humans. [ 51 ] Many scholars dispute the likelihood of unanticipated cybernetic revolt as depicted in science fiction such as The Matrix , arguing that it is more likely that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it. Pinker acknowledges the possibility of deliberate \"bad actors\", but states that in the absence of bad actors, unanticipated accidents are not a significant threat; Pinker argues that a culture of engineering safety will prevent AI researchers from accidentally unleashing malign superintelligence. [ 49 ] In contrast, Yudkowsky argues that humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by AIs which were programmed such that their goals are unintentionally incompatible with human survival or well-being (as in the film I, Robot and in the short story \" The Evitable Conflict \"). Omohundro suggests that present-day automation systems are not designed for safety and that AIs may blindly optimize narrow utility functions (say, playing chess at all costs), leading them to seek self-preservation and elimination of obstacles, including humans who might turn them off. [ 52 ] Precautions [ edit ] The AI control problem is the challenge of ensuring that advanced AI systems reliably act according to human values and intentions, even as they become more capable than humans. [ 53 ] Some scholars argue that solutions to the control problem might also find applications in existing non-superintelligent AI. [ 54 ] Major approaches to the control problem include alignment , which aims to align AI goal systems with human values, and capability control , which aims to reduce an AI system's capacity to harm humans or gain control. An example of \"capability control\" is to research whether a superintelligent AI could be successfully confined in an \" AI box \". According to Bostrom, such capability control proposals are not reliable or sufficient to solve the control problem in the long term, but may potentially act as valuable supplements to alignment efforts. [ 39 ] Prevention through AI alignment [ edit ] This paragraph is an excerpt from AI alignment . [ edit ] In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), alignment aims to steer AI systems toward a person's or group's intended goals, preferences, or ethical principles. An AI system is considered aligned if it advances the intended objectives. A misaligned AI system pursues unintended objectives.

Participate Now [Help with translations!] From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 2025 artificial intelligence report Cover sheet of the International AI Safety Report 2025 The First Independent International AI Safety Report is a report on the scientific state of research relevant to AI safety . It was published on 29 January 2025. [ 1 ] The report assesses a wide range of risks posed by general-purpose AI and how to mitigate against them. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The report was commissioned by the 30 nations attending the 2023 AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park in the United Kingdom, in order to inform discussion at the 2025 AI Action Summit in Paris, France. [ 5 ] [ 2 ] The report was published by a cohort of 96 artificial intelligence experts led by Canadian machine learning pioneer Yoshua Bengio , often referred to as one of the \"godfathers\" of AI. [ 4 ] [ 2 ] [ 6 ] In October 2025, a “Key Update” was published, outlining the implications of capability advances in reasoning language models and presenting new evidence of challenges in monitoring and controllability . [ 7 ] The second full edition of the report was released on 3 February 2026 in advance of the AI Impact Summit . [ 8 ] Capabilities of AI [ edit ] In examining what general-purpose AI can do, the report recognised that its capabilities have increased rapidly, and that the pace of further advancements may range from slow to extremely rapid. [ 4 ] [ 2 ] Policymakers thus face an \"evidence dilemma\": on the one hand, introducing mitigation measures before there is clear evidence or a risk could lead to ineffective or unnecessary mitigations. On the other hand, waiting until there is clear evidence could leave society unprepared or even make mitigation impossible. [ 4 ] AI risks [ edit ] The report groups risks from advanced AI systems into three broad categories: malicious use, technical failures, and systemic risks. Each category captures different pathways through which AI could cause harm: Malicious use [ edit ] The report highlights that AI systems can be misused for a range of hostile activities, including large-scale scams, cyberattacks, and the creation of sexualised deepfakes that disproportionately expose women and children to harassment, coercion, and abuse. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 2 ] Sexualised deepfakes are identified as a growing concern, disproportionately exposing women and children to harassment, coercion, and abuse. The report also warns that AI systems could be used to manipulate public opinion at scale through sophisticated influence campaigns and targeted disinformation, particularly during elections or political crises. Additionally, increasingly capable AI could support malicious actors in developing or enhancing biological threats. [ 1 ] Technical failures [ edit ] The report warns that even when not misused, AI systems may malfunction or behave unpredictably due to unreliable reasoning, poor generalisation, or mis-specified objectives. Such failures can lead to harmful outputs, privacy breaches, or unsafe recommendations. The report also discusses the risk that future highly capable systems may conceal unsafe behaviours during testing or operate in ways that undermine effective human oversight. [ 9 ] Systemic risks [ edit ] Beyond individual incidents, the report identifies broader structural risks arising from the growing integration of AI into critical societal systems. These include increased dependence on a small number of model providers, the potential for cascading failures across interconnected infrastructures, and the possibility that advanced AI could weaken institutional stability. The integration of AI into labour markets and the environmental costs of training large models, including substantial energy and water consumption, are identified as additional systemic concerns.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Beyond AGI, artificial superintelligence (ASI) would outperform the best human abilities across every domain by a wide margin. [ 3 ] Unlike artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), whose competence is confined to well‑defined tasks, an AGI system can generalise knowledge, transfer skills between domains, and solve novel problems without task‑specific reprogramming. Creating AGI is a stated goal of AI technology companies such as OpenAI , [ 4 ] Google , [ 5 ] xAI , [ 6 ] and Meta . [ 7 ] A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI research and development projects across 37 countries. [ 8 ] AGI is a common topic in science fiction and futures studies . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Contention exists over whether AGI represents an existential risk . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Some AI experts and industry figures have stated that mitigating the risk of human extinction posed by AGI should be a global priority. Others find the development of AGI to be in too remote a stage to present such a risk. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Terminology [ edit ] AGI is also known as strong AI, [ 17 ] [ 18 ] full AI, [ 19 ] human-level AI, [ 20 ] human-level intelligent AI, or general intelligent action. [ 21 ] Some academic sources reserve the term \"strong AI\" for computer programs that will experience sentience or consciousness . [ a ] In contrast, weak AI (or narrow AI) can solve one specific problem but lacks general cognitive abilities. [ 22 ] [ 18 ] Some academic sources use \"weak AI\" to refer more broadly to any programs that neither experience consciousness nor have a mind in the same sense as humans. [ a ] Related concepts include artificial superintelligence and transformative AI. An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical type of AGI that is much more generally intelligent than humans, [ 23 ] while the notion of transformative AI relates to AI having a large impact on society, for example, similar to the agricultural or industrial revolution. [ 24 ] A framework for classifying AGI was proposed in 2023 by Google DeepMind researchers. They define five performance levels of AGI: emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso, and superhuman. For example, a competent AGI is defined as an AI that outperforms 50% of skilled adults in a wide range of non-physical tasks, and a superhuman AGI (i.e. an artificial superintelligence) is similarly defined but with a threshold of 100%. They consider large language models like ChatGPT or LLaMA 2 to be instances of emerging AGI (comparable to unskilled humans). [ 25 ] Regarding the autonomy of AGI and associated risks, they define five levels: tool (fully in human control), consultant, collaborator, expert, and agent (fully autonomous). [ 26 ] Characteristics [ edit ] Main articles: Artificial intelligence and Philosophy of artificial intelligence Prior to the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, there was broad consensus on AGI as a theoretical benchmark for human-level machine intelligence. The capabilities demonstrated by GPT-3.5 and subsequent large language models challenged this framing directly, with some researchers and practitioners arguing that these systems already constitute AGI. The debate has since shifted from whether AGI is achievable to whether it has already been achieved and when exactly it occurred. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , who initially maintained the pre-ChatGPT framing of AGI as a future milestone, conceded by December 2025 that \"we built AGIs\" and that \"AGI kinda went whooshing by,\" proposing the field move on to defining superintelligence . [ 27 ] Computer scientist John McCarthy noted in 2007 the difficulty of characterising which computational procedures count as intelligent. [ 28 ] Intelligence traits [ edit ] Researchers generally hold that a system is required to do all of the following to be regarded as an AGI: [ 29 ] reason , use strategy, solve puzzles, and make judgments under uncertainty , represent knowledge , including common sense knowledge , plan , learn , communicate in natural language , if necessary, integrate these skills in completion of any given goal. Many interdisciplinary approaches (e.g. cognitive science , computational intelligence , and decision making ) consider additional traits such as imagination (the ability to form novel mental images and concepts) [ 30 ] and autonomy . [ 31 ] Computer-based systems exhibiting these capabilities are now widespread, with modern large language models demonstrating computational creativity , automated reasoning , and decision support simultaneously across domains. [ 32 ] Earlier systems such as evolutionary computation , intelligent agents , and robots demonstrated these capabilities in isolation, but the convergence of multiple cognitive abilities within single architectures from GPT-3.5 onwards marked a qualitative shift in the field. Physical traits [ edit ] Other capabilities are considered desirable in intelligent systems, as they may affect intelligence or aid in its expression. These include: [ 33 ] the ability to sense (e.g. see , hear, etc.), and the ability to act (e.g. move and manipulate objects , change location to explore, etc.) This includes the ability to detect and respond to hazard . [ 33 ] Tests for human-level AGI [ edit ] Several tests meant to confirm human-level AGI have been considered, including: [ 34 ] [ 35 ] The Turing Test ( Turing ) The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior and may incentivize artificial stupidity . [ 36 ] Proposed by Alan Turing in his 1950 paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", this test involves a human judge engaging in natural language conversations with both a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The machine passes the test if it can convince the judge that it is human a significant fraction of the time. Turing proposed this as a practical measure of machine intelligence, focusing on the ability to produce human-like responses rather than on the internal workings of the machine. [ 37 ] Turing described the test as follows: The idea of the test is that the machine has to try and pretend to be a man, by answering questions put to it, and it will only pass if the pretence is reasonably convincing. A considerable portion of a jury, who should not be experts about machines, must be taken in by the pretence. [ 38 ] In 2014, a chatbot named Eugene Goostman , designed to imitate a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, reportedly passed a Turing Test event by convincing 33% of judges that it was human. However, this claim was met with significant skepticism from the AI research community, who questioned the test's implementation and its relevance to AGI. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] In 2023, Kirk-Giannini and Goldstein argued that while large language models were approaching the threshold of passing the Turing test, \"imitation\" is not synonymous with \"intelligence\". [ 41 ] This distinction has been challenged on scientific grounds: neuroscience has established that biological intelligence arises from electrochemical signalling between neurons — a purely physical process with no known non-physical component. [ 42 ] Both biological neural networks and artificial neural networks are physical systems processing information according to physical laws; to claim that one substrate produces \"real\" intelligence while the other produces \"mere imitation\" despite equivalent observable behaviour requires positing a non-physical property unique to biological matter — a position incompatible with modern science and indistinguishable from substance dualism . [ 43 ] A 2024 study suggested that GPT-4 was identified as human 54% of the time in a randomized, controlled version of the Turing Test—surpassing older chatbots like ELIZA while still falling behind actual humans (67%). [ 44 ] A 2025 pre‑registered, three‑party Turing‑test study by Cameron R. Jones and Benjamin K. Bergen showed that GPT-4.5 was judged to be the human in 73% of five‑minute text conversations—surpassing the 67% humanness rate of real confederates and meeting the researchers' criterion for having passed the test. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] The Robot College Student Test ( Goertzel ) A machine enrolls in a university, taking and passing the same classes that humans would, and obtaining a degree. LLMs can now pass university degree-level exams without even attending the classes. [ 47 ] The Employment Test ( Nilsson ) A machine performs an economically important job at least as well as humans in the same job. This test is now arguably passed across multiple domains. In knowledge work, frontier large language models are deployed as autonomous agentic systems handling software engineering, legal research, financial analysis, customer service, and marketing tasks end-to-end. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] In physical labour, LLM-powered humanoid robots are entering both industrial and domestic environments. Figure AI 's robots operate fully autonomously in factory and warehouse settings, with manufacturers including BMW deploying them on production lines. [ 50 ] Boston Dynamics has similarly demonstrated advanced autonomous robotics in industrial applications. 1X Technologies ' NEO humanoid, available for pre-order at $20,000 with deliveries beginning in 2026, targets household tasks such as tidying, laundry, and fetching items. [ 51 ] Unlike Figure's fully autonomous factory deployments, NEO ships with basic autonomy and uses a human-in-the-loop \"Expert Mode\" where remote operators supervise complex tasks the robot has not yet learned — a strategy driven by the data collection challenge inherent to training robots for the diversity of home environments. [ 52 ] Tesla 's Optimus programme has announced similar consumer ambitions. The remaining frontier is fully autonomous general-purpose home robotics, where the unstructured nature of domestic environments presents a harder data and generalisation problem than controlled industrial settings. The Ikea test ( Marcus ) Also known as the Flat Pack Furniture Test. An AI views the parts and instructions of an Ikea flat-pack product, then controls a robot to assemble the furniture correctly. [ 53 ] As early as 2013, MIT's IkeaBot demonstrated fully autonomous multi-robot assembly of an IKEA Lack table in ten minutes, with no human intervention and no pre-programmed assembly instructions — the robots inferred the assembly sequence from the geometry of the parts alone. [ 54 ] In December 2025, MIT researchers demonstrated a \"speech-to-reality\" system combining large language models with vision-language models and robotic assembly: a user says \"I want a simple stool\" and a robotic arm constructs the furniture from modular components within five minutes, using generative AI to reason about geometry, function, and assembly sequence from natural language alone. [ 55 ] The FurnitureBench benchmark, published in the International Journal of Robotics Research in 2025, now provides a standardised real-world furniture assembly benchmark with over 200 hours of demonstration data for training and evaluating autonomous assembly systems. [ 56 ] The Coffee Test ( Wozniak ) A machine is required to enter an average American home and figure out how to make coffee: find the coffee machine, find the coffee, add water, find a mug, and brew the coffee by pushing the proper buttons. [ 57 ] This test has been substantially approached across multiple systems. In January 2024, Figure AI 's Figure 01 humanoid learned to operate a Keurig coffee machine autonomously after watching video demonstrations, using end-to-end neural networks to translate visual input into motor actions. [ 58 ] In 2025, researchers at the University of Edinburgh published the ELLMER framework in Nature Machine Intelligence , demonstrating a robotic arm that interprets verbal instructions, analyses its surroundings, and autonomously makes coffee in dynamic kitchen environments — adapting to unforeseen obstacles in real time rather than following pre-programmed sequences. [ 59 ] China-based Stardust Intelligence demonstrated its Astribot S1 using Physical Intelligence 's π₀ model to make coffee from the high-level command \"make coffee\", with the system identifying objects such as mugs and coffee makers even when misplaced or in unexpected locations. [ 60 ] Physical Intelligence subsequently reported that its π*0.6 model could make espresso continuously for an entire day with failure rates dropping by more than half compared to earlier versions. [ 61 ] The strict form of the test — entering a completely unfamiliar home and navigating it from scratch — has not been formally demonstrated end-to-end, though the combination of LLM-driven reasoning, visual object recognition in novel environments, and autonomous manipulation brings current systems close to meeting the original specification. The Modern Turing Test ( Suleyman ) An AI model is given US$100,000 and has to obtain US$1 million. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] This test was arguably surpassed in October 2024 by Truth Terminal, a semi-autonomous AI agent built on Meta 's Llama 3.1 (with earlier iterations based on Claude 3 Opus ). Created by AI researcher Andy Ayrey, Truth Terminal originated from an experiment called \"Infinite Backrooms\" in which two Claude Opus instances were allowed to converse freely, during which they spontaneously generated a satirical meme religion dubbed the \"Goatse Gospel\". [ 64 ] After venture capitalist Marc Andreessen donated US$50,000 in Bitcoin to the agent, Truth Terminal's promotion of the Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) memecoin on the Solana blockchain drove the token to over US$1 billion in market capitalisation within days of its launch — far exceeding Suleyman's US$1 million threshold. [ 65 ] Truth Terminal's own crypto wallet accumulated approximately US$37.5 million, making it the first AI agent to become a millionaire through its own market activity. [ 66 ] The test's spirit — demonstrating that an AI can generate substantial economic value from a modest starting position — was met, though with caveats: Ayrey reviewed posts before publication and assisted with wallet mechanics, making the agent semi-autonomous rather than fully independent. The General Video-Game Learning Test ( Goertzel , Bach et al.) An AI must demonstrate the ability to learn and succeed at a wide range of video games, including new games unknown to the AGI developers before the competition. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] The importance of this threshold was echoed by Scott Aaronson during his time at OpenAI. [ 69 ] In December 2025, Google DeepMind released SIMA 2 (Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent), a Gemini -powered generalist agent that operates across multiple commercial 3D games — including No Man's Sky , Valheim , and Goat Simulator 3 — using only rendered pixels and a virtual keyboard and mouse, with no access to game source code or internal APIs. [ 70 ] Where the original SIMA achieved a 31% success rate on complex tasks compared to humans at 71%, SIMA 2 roughly doubled that rate and demonstrated robust generalisation to previously unseen game environments, including self-improvement through autonomous play without human feedback. [ 71 ] Separately, frontier LLMs with computer-use capabilities can interact with arbitrary software through screen observation and mouse/keyboard control, theoretically enabling gameplay of any title, though current implementations remain too slow for real-time performance in fast-paced games. The test has not been formally passed in its strictest sense — a single agent mastering any arbitrary unseen game at human level — but the gap is narrowing rapidly. AI-complete problems [ edit ] Main article: AI-complete A problem is informally called \"AI-complete\" or \"AI-hard\" if it is believed that AGI would be needed to solve it, because the solution is beyond the capabilities of a purpose-specific algorithm. [ 72 ] Many problems have been conjectured to require general intelligence to solve. Examples include computer vision , natural language understanding , and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real-world problem. [ 73 ] Even a specific task like translation requires a machine to read and write in both languages, follow the author's argument (reason), understand the context (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent ( social intelligence ). All of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance. However, many of these tasks can now be performed by modern large language models. According to Stanford University 's 2024 AI index, AI has reached human-level performance on many benchmarks for reading comprehension and visual reasoning. [ 74 ] History [ edit ] Classical AI [ edit ] Main articles: History of artificial intelligence and Symbolic artificial intelligence Modern AI research began in the mid-1950s. [ 75 ] The first generation of AI researchers were convinced that artificial general intelligence was possible and that it would exist in just a few decades. [ 76 ] AI pioneer Herbert A. Simon wrote in 1965: \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.\" [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Their predictions were the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke 's fictional character HAL 9000 , who embodied what AI researchers believed they could create by the year 2001. AI pioneer Marvin Minsky was a consultant [ 79 ] on the project of making HAL 9000 as realistic as possible according to the consensus predictions of the time. He said in 1967, \"Within a generation... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\". [ 80 ] Several classical AI projects , such as Doug Lenat 's Cyc project (that began in 1984), and Allen Newell 's Soar project, were directed at AGI. However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. Funding agencies became skeptical of AGI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful \"applied AI\". [ b ] In the early 1980s, Japan's Fifth Generation Computer Project revived interest in AGI, setting out a ten-year timeline that included AGI goals like \"carry on a casual conversation\". [ 84 ] In response to this and the success of expert systems , both industry and government pumped money into the field. [ 82 ] [ 85 ] However, confidence in AI spectacularly collapsed in the late 1980s, and the goals of the Fifth Generation Computer Project were never fulfilled. [ 86 ] For the second time in 20 years, AI researchers who predicted the imminent achievement of AGI had been mistaken. By the 1990s, AI researchers had a reputation for making vain promises. They became reluctant to make predictions at all [ c ] and avoided mention of \"human level\" artificial intelligence for fear of being labeled \"wild-eyed dreamer[s]\". [ 88 ] Narrow AI research [ edit ] Main article: Artificial intelligence In the 1990s and early 21st century, mainstream AI achieved commercial success and academic respectability by focusing on specific sub-problems where AI can produce verifiable results and commercial applications, such as speech recognition and recommendation algorithms . [ 89 ] These \"applied AI\" systems are now used extensively throughout the technology industry, and research in this vein is heavily funded in both academia and industry. As of 2018 [update] , development in this field was considered an emerging trend, and a mature stage was expected to be reached in more than 10 years. [ 90 ] At the turn of the century, many mainstream AI researchers [ 91 ] hoped that strong AI could be developed by combining programs that solve various sub-problems. Hans Moravec wrote in 1988: I am confident that this bottom-up route to artificial intelligence will one day meet the traditional top-down route more than halfway, ready to provide the real-world competence and the commonsense knowledge that has been so frustratingly elusive in reasoning programs. Fully intelligent machines will result when the metaphorical golden spike is driven, uniting the two efforts. [ 91 ] However, even at the time, this was disputed. For example, Stevan Harnad of Princeton University concluded his 1990 paper on the symbol grounding hypothesis by stating: The expectation has often been voiced that \"top-down\" (symbolic) approaches to modeling cognition will somehow meet \"bottom-up\" (sensory) approaches somewhere in between. If the grounding considerations in this paper are valid, then this expectation is hopelessly modular and there is really only one viable route from sense to symbols: from the ground up. A free-floating symbolic level like the software level of a computer will never be reached by this route (or vice versa) – nor is it clear why we should even try to reach such a level, since it looks as if getting there would just amount to uprooting our symbols from their intrinsic meanings (thereby merely reducing ourselves to the functional equivalent of a programmable computer). [ 92 ] Modern artificial general intelligence research [ edit ] The term \"artificial general intelligence\" was used as early as 1997, by Mark Gubrud [ 93 ] in a discussion of the implications of fully automated military production and operations. A mathematical formalism of AGI was proposed by Marcus Hutter in 2000. Named AIXI , the proposed AGI agent maximizes \"the ability to satisfy goals in a wide range of environments\". [ 94 ] This type of AGI, characterized by the ability to maximize a mathematical definition of intelligence rather than exhibit human-like behaviour, [ 95 ] was also called universal artificial intelligence. [ 96 ] The term AGI was re-introduced and popularized by Shane Legg and Ben Goertzel around 2002. [ 97 ] AGI research activity in 2006 was described by Pei Wang and Ben Goertzel [ 98 ] as \"producing publications and preliminary results\". The first summer school on AGI was organized in Xiamen, China in 2009 [ 99 ] by the Xiamen university's Artificial Brain Laboratory and OpenCog . The first university course was given in 2010 [ 100 ] and 2011 [ 101 ] at Plovdiv University, Bulgaria by Todor Arnaudov. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) presented a course on AGI in 2018, organized by Lex Fridman and featuring a number of guest lecturers. Feasibility [ edit ] Surveys about when experts expect artificial general intelligence [ 20 ] As of 2023, the development and potential achievement of AGI remains a subject of intense debate within the AI community. While traditional consensus held that AGI was a distant goal, recent advancements have led some researchers and industry figures to claim that early forms of AGI may already exist. [ 102 ] AI pioneer Herbert A. Simon speculated in 1965 that \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". This prediction failed to come true. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen believed that such intelligence is unlikely in the 21st century because it would require \"unforeseeable and fundamentally unpredictable breakthroughs\" and a \"scientifically deep understanding of cognition\". [ 103 ] Writing in The Guardian , roboticist Alan Winfield claimed in 2014 that the gulf between modern computing and human-level artificial intelligence is as wide as the gulf between current space flight and practical faster-than-light spaceflight. [ 104 ] An additional challenge is the lack of clarity in defining what intelligence entails. Does it require consciousness? Must it display the ability to set goals as well as pursue them? Is it purely a matter of scale such that if model sizes increase sufficiently, intelligence will emerge? Are facilities such as planning, reasoning, and causal understanding required? Does intelligence require explicitly replicating the brain and its specific faculties? Does it require emotions? [ 105 ] Most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, but some thinkers, like Hubert Dreyfus and Roger Penrose , deny the possibility of achieving strong AI. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] John McCarthy is among those who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but that the present level of progress is such that a date cannot accurately be predicted. [ 108 ] AI experts' views on the feasibility of AGI wax and wane. Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the median estimate among experts for when they would be 50% confident AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050, depending on the poll, with the mean being 2081. Of the experts, 16.5% answered with \"never\" when asked the same question, but with a 90% confidence instead. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Further current AGI progress considerations can be found above Tests for confirming human-level AGI . A report by Stuart Armstrong and Kaj Sotala of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute found that \"over [a] 60-year time frame there is a strong bias towards predicting the arrival of human-level AI as between 15 and 25 years from the time the prediction was made\". They analyzed 95 predictions made between 1950 and 2012 on when human-level AI will come about. [ 111 ] In 2023, Microsoft researchers published a detailed evaluation of GPT-4 . They concluded: \"Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system.\" [ 112 ] Another study in 2023 reported that GPT-4 outperforms 99% of humans on the Torrance tests of creative thinking . [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Blaise Agüera y Arcas and Peter Norvig wrote in 2023 the article \"Artificial General Intelligence Is Already Here\", arguing that frontier models had already achieved a significant level of general intelligence. They wrote that reluctance to this view comes from four main reasons: a \"healthy skepticism about metrics for AGI\", an \"ideological commitment to alternative AI theories or techniques\", a \"devotion to human (or biological) exceptionalism\", or a \"concern about the economic implications of AGI\". [ 115 ] Timescales [ edit ] AI has surpassed humans on a variety of language understanding and visual understanding benchmarks. [ 116 ] As of 2023, foundation models still lack advanced reasoning and planning capabilities, but rapid progress is expected. [ 117 ] Progress in artificial intelligence has historically gone through periods of rapid progress separated by periods when progress appeared to stop. [ 106 ] Ending each hiatus were fundamental advances in hardware, software or both to create space for further progress. [ 106 ] [ 118 ] [ 119 ] For example, the computer hardware available in the twentieth century was not sufficient to implement deep learning , which requires large numbers of GPU -enabled CPUs . [ 120 ] In the introduction to his 2006 book, [ 121 ] Goertzel says that estimates of the time needed before a truly flexible AGI is built vary from 10 years to over a century. As of 2007 [update] , the consensus in the AGI research community seemed to be that the timeline discussed by Ray Kurzweil in 2005 in The Singularity is Near [ 122 ] (i.e. between 2015 and 2045) was plausible. [ 123 ] Mainstream AI researchers have given a wide range of opinions on whether progress will be this rapid. A 2012 meta-analysis of 95 such opinions found a bias towards predicting that the onset of AGI would occur within 16–26 years for modern and historical predictions alike. That paper has been criticized for how it categorized opinions as expert or non-expert. [ 124 ] In 2012, Alex Krizhevsky , Ilya Sutskever , and Geoffrey Hinton developed a neural network called AlexNet , which won the ImageNet competition with a top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, significantly better than the second-best entry's rate of 26.3% (the traditional approach used a weighted sum of scores from different pre-defined classifiers). [ 125 ] AlexNet was regarded as the initial ground-breaker of the current deep learning wave. [ 125 ] In 2017, researchers Feng Liu, Yong Shi, and Ying Liu conducted intelligence tests on publicly available and freely accessible weak AI such as Google AI, Apple 's Siri , and others. At the maximum, these AIs reached an IQ value of about 47, which corresponds approximately to a six-year-old child in first grade. An adult comes to about 100 on average. Similar tests were carried out in 2014, with the IQ score reaching a maximum value of 27. [ 126 ] [ 127 ] In 2020, OpenAI developed GPT-3 , a language model capable of performing many diverse tasks without specific training. According to Gary Grossman in a VentureBeat article, while there is consensus that GPT-3 is not an example of AGI, it is considered by some to be too advanced to be classified as a narrow AI system. [ 128 ] In the same year, Jason Rohrer used his GPT-3 account to develop a chatbot, and provided a chatbot-developing platform called \"Project December\". OpenAI asked for changes to the chatbot to comply with their safety guidelines; Rohrer disconnected Project December from the GPT-3 API. [ 129 ] In 2022, DeepMind developed Gato , a \"general-purpose\" system capable of performing more than 600 different tasks. [ 130 ] In 2023, AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton stated that: [ 131 ] The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people – a few people believed that, [...]. But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that. He estimated in 2024 (with low confidence) that systems smarter than humans could appear within 5 to 20 years and stressed the attendant existential risks. [ 132 ] In May 2023, Demis Hassabis similarly said that \"The progress in the last few years has been pretty incredible\", and that he sees no reason why it would slow, expecting AGI within a decade or even a few years. [ 133 ] In March 2024, Nvidia 's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Jensen Huang , stated his expectation that within five years, AI would be capable of passing any test at least as well as humans. [ 134 ] In June 2024, the AI researcher Leopold Aschenbrenner , a former OpenAI employee, estimated AGI by 2027 to be \"strikingly plausible\". [ 135 ] In September 2025, a review of surveys of scientists and industry experts from the last 15 years reported that most agreed that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will occur before the year 2100. [ 136 ] A more recent analysis by AIMultiple reported that, “Current surveys of AI researchers are predicting AGI around 2040”. [ 136 ] Whole brain emulation [ edit ] Main articles: Whole brain emulation and Brain simulation While the development of transformer models like in ChatGPT is considered the most promising path to AGI, [ 137 ] [ 138 ] whole brain emulation can serve as an alternative approach. With whole brain simulation, a brain model is built by scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail, and then copying and simulating it on a computer system or another computational device. The simulation model must be sufficiently faithful to the original, so that it behaves in practically the same way as the original brain. [ 139 ] Whole brain emulation is a type of brain simulation that is discussed in computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics , and for medical research purposes. It has been discussed in artificial intelligence research [ 123 ] as an approach to strong AI. Neuroimaging technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and futurist Ray Kurzweil in the book The Singularity Is Near [ 122 ] predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the computing power required to emulate it. Early estimates [ edit ] Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, Anders Sandberg and Nick Bostrom ), along with the fastest supercomputer from TOP500 mapped by year. Note the logarithmic scale and exponential trendline, which assumes the computational capacity doubles every 1.2 years. Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where consciousness arises. [ 140 ] For low-level brain simulation, a very powerful cluster of computers or GPUs would be required, given the enormous quantity of synapses within the human brain . Each of the 10 11 (one hundred billion) neurons has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. The brain of a three-year-old child has about 10 15 synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10 14 to 5×10 14 synapses (100 to 500 trillion). [ 141 ] An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10 14 (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ( SUPS ). [ 142 ] In 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10 16 computations per second. [ d ] (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \" floating-point operation \" – a measure used to rate current supercomputers – then 10 16 \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 petaFLOPS , achieved in 2011 , while 10 18 was achieved in 2022 .) He used this figure to predict that the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued. Current research [ edit ] The Human Brain Project , an EU -funded initiative active from 2013 to 2023, has developed a particularly detailed and publicly accessible atlas of the human brain. [ 145 ] In 2023, researchers from Duke University performed a high-resolution scan of a mouse brain. Criticisms of simulation-based approaches [ edit ] The artificial neuron model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current artificial neural network implementations is simple compared with biological neurons . A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological neurons , presently understood only in broad outline. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate. In addition, the estimates do not account for glial cells , which are known to play a role in cognitive processes. [ 146 ] A fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from embodied cognition theory, which asserts that human embodiment is an essential aspect of human intelligence and is necessary to ground meaning. [ 147 ] [ 148 ] If this theory is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (e.g., a robotic body). Goertzel [ 123 ] proposes virtual embodiment (like in metaverses like Second Life ) as an option, but it is unknown whether this would be sufficient. Philosophical perspective [ edit ] See also: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Turing test \"Strong AI\" as defined in philosophy [ edit ] In 1980, philosopher John Searle coined the term \"strong AI\" as part of his Chinese room argument. [ 149 ] He proposed a distinction between two hypotheses about artificial intelligence: [ e ] Strong AI hypothesis : An artificial intelligence system can have \"a mind\" and \"consciousness\". Weak AI hypothesis : An artificial intelligence system can (only) act like it thinks and has a mind and consciousness. The first one he called \"strong\" because it makes a stronger statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond those abilities that we can test. The behaviour of a \"weak AI\" machine would be identical to a \"strong AI\" machine, but the latter would also have subjective conscious experience. This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks. [ 150 ] In contrast to Searle and mainstream AI, some futurists such as Ray Kurzweil use the term \"strong AI\" to mean \"human level artificial general intelligence\". [ 122 ] This is not the same as Searle's strong AI , unless it is assumed that consciousness is necessary for human-level AGI. Academic philosophers such as Searle do not believe that is the case, and to most artificial intelligence researchers, the question is out of scope. [ 151 ] Mainstream AI is most interested in how a program behaves . [ 152 ] According to Russell and Norvig , \"as long as the program works, they don't care if you call it real or a simulation.\" [ 151 ] If the program can behave as if it has a mind, then there is no need to know if it actually has a mind – indeed, there would be no way to tell. For AI research, Searle's \"weak AI hypothesis\" is equivalent to the statement \"artificial general intelligence is possible\". Thus, according to Russell and Norvig, \"most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\" [ 151 ] Thus, for academic AI research, \"Strong AI\" and \"AGI\" are two different things. Consciousness [ edit ] Main article: Artificial consciousness Consciousness can have various meanings, and some aspects play significant roles in science fiction and the ethics of artificial intelligence : Sentience (or \"phenomenal consciousness\"): The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively, as opposed to the ability to reason about perceptions. Some philosophers, such as David Chalmers , use the term \"consciousness\" to refer exclusively to phenomenal consciousness, which is roughly equivalent to sentience. [ 153 ] Determining why and how subjective experience arises is known as the hard problem of consciousness . [ 154 ] Thomas Nagel explained in 1974 that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \" what does it feel like to be a bat? \" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e., has consciousness) but a toaster does not. [ 155 ] In 2022, a Google engineer claimed that the company's AI chatbot, LaMDA , had achieved sentience, though this claim was widely disputed by other experts. [ 156 ] Self-awareness : To have conscious awareness of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be consciously aware of one's own thoughts. This is opposed to simply being the \"subject of one's thought\"—an operating system or debugger can be \"aware of itself\" (that is, to represent itself in the same way it represents everything else)—but this is not what people typically mean when they use the term \"self-awareness\". [ f ] In some advanced AI models, systems construct internal representations of their own cognitive processes and feedback patterns—occasionally referring to themselves using second-person constructs such as 'you' within self-modeling frameworks. [ citation needed ] These traits have a moral dimension. AI sentience would give rise to concerns of welfare and legal protection, similarly to animals. [ 157 ] Other aspects of consciousness related to cognitive capabilities are also relevant to the concept of AI rights. [ 158 ] Figuring out how to integrate advanced AI with existing legal and social frameworks is an emergent issue. [ 159 ] Benefits [ edit ] AGI could improve productivity and efficiency in most jobs. For example, in public health, AGI could accelerate medical research, notably against cancer. [ 160 ] It could take care of the elderly, [ 161 ] and democratize access to rapid, high-quality medical diagnostics. It could offer fun, inexpensive and personalized education. [ 161 ] The need to work to subsist could become obsolete if the wealth produced is properly redistributed . [ 161 ] [ 162 ] This also raises the question of the place of humans in a radically automated society. AGI could also help to make rational decisions, and to anticipate and prevent disasters. It could also help to reap the benefits of potentially catastrophic technologies such as nanotechnology or climate engineering , while avoiding the associated risks. [ 163 ] If an AGI's primary goal is to prevent existential catastrophes such as human extinction (which could be difficult if the Vulnerable World Hypothesis turns out to be true), [ 164 ] it could take measures to drastically reduce the risks [ 163 ] while minimizing the impact of these measures on our quality of life. Advancements in medicine and healthcare [ edit ] AGI would improve healthcare by making medical diagnostics faster, less expensive, and more accurate. AI-driven systems can analyse patient data and detect diseases at an early stage. [ 165 ] This means patients will get diagnosed quicker and be able to seek medical attention before their medical condition gets worse. AGI systems could also recommend personalised treatment plans based on genetics and medical history. [ 166 ] Additionally, AGI could accelerate drug discovery by simulating molecular interactions, reducing the time it takes to develop new medicines for conditions like cancer and Alzheimer's disease. [ 167 ] In hospitals, AGI-powered robotic assistants could assist in surgeries, monitor patients, and provide real-time medical support. It could also be used in elderly care, helping aging populations maintain independence through AI-powered caregivers and health-monitoring systems. By evaluating large datasets, AGI can assist in developing personalised treatment plans tailored to individual patient needs. This approach ensures that therapies are optimised based on a patient's unique medical history and genetic profile, improving outcomes and reducing adverse effects. [ 168 ] Advancements in science and technology [ edit ] AGI can become a tool for scientific research and innovation. In fields such as physics and mathematics, AGI could help solve complex problems that require massive computational power, such as modeling quantum systems, understanding dark matter, or proving mathematical theorems. [ 169 ] Problems that have remained unsolved for decades may be solved with AGI. AGI could also drive technological breakthroughs that could reshape society. It can do this by optimising engineering designs, discovering new materials, and improving automation. For example, AI is already playing a role in developing more efficient renewable energy sources and optimising supply chains in manufacturing. [ 170 ] Future AGI systems could push these innovations further. Enhancing education and productivity [ edit ] AGI can personalize education by creating learning programs that are specific to each student's strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Unlike traditional teaching methods, AI-driven tutoring systems could adapt lessons in real-time, ensuring students understand difficult concepts before moving on. [ 171 ] In the workplace, AGI could automate repetitive tasks, freeing workers for more creative and strategic roles. [ 170 ] It could also improve efficiency across industries by optimising logistics, enhancing cybersecurity, and streamlining business operations. If properly managed, the wealth generated by AGI-driven automation could reduce the need for people to work for a living. Working may become optional. [ 172 ] Mitigating global crises [ edit ] AGI could play a crucial role in preventing and managing global threats. It could help governments and organizations predict and respond to natural disasters more effectively, using real-time data analysis to forecast hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemics. [ 173 ] By analyzing vast datasets from satellites, sensors, and historical records, AGI could improve early warning systems, enabling faster disaster response and minimising casualties. In climate science, AGI could develop new models for reducing carbon emissions, optimising energy resources, and mitigating climate change effects. It could also enhance weather prediction accuracy, allowing policymakers to implement more effective environmental regulations. Additionally, AGI could help regulate emerging technologies that carry significant risks, such as nanotechnology and bioengineering, by analysing complex systems and predicting unintended consequences. [ 169 ] Furthermore, AGI could assist in cybersecurity by detecting and mitigating large-scale cyber threats, protecting critical infrastructure, and preventing digital warfare. Revitalising environmental conservation and biodiversity [ edit ] AGI could significantly contribute to preserving the natural environment and protecting endangered species. By analyzing satellite imagery, climate data, and wildlife patterns, AGI systems could identify environmental threats earlier and recommend targeted conservation strategies. [ 174 ] AGI could help optimize land use, monitor illegal activities like poaching or deforestation in real-time, and support global efforts to restore ecosystems. Advanced predictive models developed by AGI could also assist in reversing biodiversity loss, ensuring the survival of critical species and maintaining ecological balance. [ 175 ] Enhancing space exploration and colonization [ edit ] AGI could revolutionize humanity's ability to explore and settle beyond Earth. With its advanced problem-solving skills, AGI could autonomously manage complex space missions, including navigation, resource management, and emergency response. It could accelerate the design of life support systems, habitats, and spacecraft optimized for extraterrestrial environments. Furthermore, AGI could support efforts to colonize planets like Mars by simulating survival scenarios and helping humans adapt to new worlds, expanding the possibilities for interplanetary civilization. [ 176 ] Risks [ edit ] Existential risks [ edit ] Main articles: Existential risk from artificial general intelligence and AI safety AGI may represent multiple types of existential risk , which are risks that threaten \"the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development\". [ 177 ] The risk of human extinction from AGI has been the topic of many debates, but there is also the possibility that the development of AGI would lead to a permanently flawed future. Notably, it could be used to spread and preserve the set of values of whoever develops it. If humanity still has moral blind spots similar to slavery in the past, AGI might irreversibly entrench them, preventing moral progress . [ 178 ] Furthermore, AGI could facilitate mass surveillance and indoctrination, which could be used to create an entrenched repressive worldwide totalitarian regime. [ 179 ] [ 180 ] There is also a risk for the machines themselves. If machines that are sentient or otherwise worthy of moral consideration are mass-created in the future, engaging in a civilizational path that indefinitely neglects their welfare and interests could be an existential catastrophe. [ 181 ] [ 182 ] Considering how much AGI could improve humanity's future and help reduce other existential risks, Toby Ord calls these existential risks \"an argument for proceeding with due caution\", not for \"abandoning AI\". [ 179 ] Risk of loss of control and human extinction [ edit ] The thesis that AI poses an existential risk for humans, and that this risk needs more attention, is controversial but has been endorsed in 2023 by many public figures, AI researchers and CEOs of AI companies such as Elon Musk , Bill Gates , Geoffrey Hinton , Yoshua Bengio , Demis Hassabis and Sam Altman . [ 183 ] [ 184 ] In 2014, Stephen Hawking criticized widespread indifference: So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong. If a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, 'We'll arrive in a few decades,' would we just reply, 'OK, call us when you get here—we'll leave the lights on?' Probably not—but this is more or less what is happening with AI. [ 185 ] The potential fate of humanity has sometimes been compared to the fate of gorillas threatened by human activities. The comparison states that greater intelligence allowed humanity to dominate gorillas, which are now vulnerable in ways that they could not have anticipated. As a result, the gorilla has become an endangered species, not out of malice, but simply as collateral damage from human activities. [ 186 ] The skeptic Yann LeCun considers that AGIs will have no desire to dominate humanity and that we should be careful not to anthropomorphize them and interpret their intentions as we would for humans. He said that people won't be \"smart enough to design super-intelligent machines, yet ridiculously stupid to the point of giving it moronic objectives with no safeguards\". [ 187 ] On the other side, the concept of instrumental convergence suggests that almost whatever their goals, intelligent agents will have reasons to try to survive and acquire more power as intermediary steps to achieving these goals. And that this does not require having emotions. [ 188 ] Many scholars who are concerned about existential risk advocate for more research into solving the \" control problem \" to answer the question: what types of safeguards, algorithms, or architectures can programmers implement to maximise the probability that their recursively-improving AI would continue to behave in a friendly , rather than destructive, manner after it reaches superintelligence? [ 189 ] [ 190 ] Solving the control problem is complicated by the AI arms race (which could lead to a race to the bottom of safety precautions in order to release products before competitors), [ 191 ] and the use of AI in weapon systems. [ 192 ] The thesis that AI can pose existential risk also has detractors. Skeptics usually say that AGI is unlikely in the short term, or that concerns about AGI distract from other issues related to current AI. [ 193 ] Former Google fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder considers that for many people outside of the technology industry, existing chatbots and LLMs are already perceived as though they were AGI, leading to further misunderstanding and fear. [ 194 ] Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God. [ 195 ] Some researchers believe that the communication campaigns on AI existential risk by certain AI groups (such as OpenAI, Anthropic , DeepMind, and Conjecture) may be an at attempt at regulatory capture and to inflate interest in their products. [ 196 ] [ 197 ] In 2023, the CEOs of Google DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic, along with other industry leaders and researchers, issued a joint statement asserting that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\" [ 184 ] Mass unemployment [ edit ] Researchers from OpenAI estimated in 2023 that \"80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted\". [ 198 ] [ 199 ] They consider office workers to be the most exposed, for example mathematicians, accountants or web designers. [ 199 ] AGI could have a better autonomy, ability to make decisions, to interface with other computer tools, but also to control robotized bodies. A common belief among top AI company insiders is that most workers will face technological unemployment from AGI, starting with white-collar jobs and, as robotics improves, extending to blue-collar jobs . [ 200 ] Critics of the idea argue that AGI will complement rather than replace humans, and that automation displaces work in the short term but not in the long term. [ 201 ] [ 202 ] [ 203 ] According to Stephen Hawking, the outcome of automation on the quality of life will depend on how the wealth will be redistributed: [ 162 ] Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality Elon Musk argued in 2021 that the automation of society will require governments to adopt a universal basic income (UBI). [ 204 ] Hinton similarly advised the UK government in 2025 to adopt a UBI as a response to AI-induced unemployment. [ 205 ] In 2023, Hinton said \"I'm a socialist [...] I think that private ownership of the media, and of the 'means of computation', is not good.\" [ 206 ] See also [ edit ] AI alignment – Conformance of AI to intended objectives AI effect A.I.

Glossary of computer science Category v t e The history of artificial intelligence ( AI ) began in antiquity , with myths, stories, and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The study of logic and formal reasoning from antiquity to the present led directly to the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on abstract mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired scientists to begin discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain . The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College in 1956. [ 1 ] Attendees of the workshop became the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that machines as intelligent as humans would exist within a generation. The U.S. government provided millions of dollars with the hope of making this vision come true. [ 2 ] Eventually, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of this feat. [ 3 ] In 1974, criticism from James Lighthill and pressure from the U.S. Congress led the U.S. and British Governments to stop funding undirected research into artificial intelligence. Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government and the success of expert systems reinvigorated investment in AI, and by the late 1980s, the industry had grown into a billion-dollar enterprise. However, investors' enthusiasm waned in the 1990s, and the field was criticized in the press and avoided by industry (a period known as an \" AI winter \"). Nevertheless, research and funding continued to grow under other names. In the early 2000s, machine learning was applied to a wide range of problems in academia and industry. The success was due to the availability of powerful computer hardware, the collection of immense data sets, and the application of solid mathematical methods. Soon after, deep learning proved to be a breakthrough technology, eclipsing all other methods. The transformer architecture debuted in 2017 and was used to produce impressive generative AI applications, amongst other use cases. Investment in AI boomed in the 2020s. The recent AI boom, initiated by the development of transformer architecture, led to the rapid scaling and public releases of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT . These models exhibit human-like traits of knowledge, attention, and creativity, and have been integrated into various sectors, fueling exponential investment in AI. However, concerns about the potential risks and ethical implications of advanced AI have also emerged, causing debate about the future of AI and its impact on society. Precursors [ edit ] Myth, folklore, and fiction [ edit ] Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction Mythology and folklore has depictions of automatons and similar human-like artificial life. In Greek mythology , Talos was a creature made of bronze who acted as a guardian for the island of Crete . [ 4 ] Alchemists in the Islamic Golden Age , such as Jabir ibn Hayyan , attempted Takwin , the artificial creation of life, including human life, although this may have been metaphorical. [ 5 ] In Jewish folklore during the Middle Ages, a Golem was a clay sculpture that was said to have come to life through the insertion of a piece of paper with any of God's names on it into the mouth. [ 6 ] 16th century Swiss alchemist Paracelsus described a procedure he claimed would fabricate a homunculus , or artificial man. [ 7 ] Brazen heads were a recurring motif in late medieval and early modern folklore. [ 8 ] By the 19th century, ideas about artificial men and thinking machines became a popular theme in fiction. Notable works like Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe 's, Faust, Part Two , and Karel Čapek 's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Speculative essays, such as Samuel Butler 's \" Darwin among the Machines \", [ 11 ] and Edgar Allan Poe's \" Maelzel's Chess Player \" [ 12 ] reflected society's growing interest in machines with artificial intelligence. [ 13 ] Automata [ edit ] Main article: Automaton Al-Jazari 's programmable automata (1206 CE) Realistic humanoid automata were built by craftsman from many civilizations, including Yan Shi , [ 14 ] Hero of Alexandria , [ 15 ] Al-Jazari , [ 16 ] Haroun al-Rashid , [ 17 ] Jacques de Vaucanson , [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Leonardo Torres y Quevedo , [ 20 ] Pierre Jaquet-Droz and Wolfgang von Kempelen . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The oldest known automata were sacred statues of ancient Egypt and Greece . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] The faithful believed that craftsman had imbued these figures with very real minds, capable of wisdom and emotion— Hermes Trismegistus wrote that \"by discovering the true nature of the gods, man has been able to reproduce it\". [ 25 ] English scholar Alexander Neckham asserted that the Ancient Roman poet Virgil had built a palace with automaton statues. [ 26 ] Formal reasoning [ edit ] See also: Reason § Philosophical history Artificial intelligence is based on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized. Philosophers had developed structured methods of formal deduction by the first millennium BCE. Spanish philosopher Ramon Llull (1232–1315) developed several logical machines devoted to the production of knowledge by logical means; [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic and undeniable truths by simple logical operations, produced by the machine by mechanical meanings, in such ways as to produce all the possible knowledge. [ 29 ] Llull's work had a great influence on Gottfried Leibniz , who redeveloped his ideas. [ 30 ] Gottfried Leibniz , who speculated that human reason could be reduced to mechanical calculation In the 17th century, Leibniz , Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes explored the possibility that all rational thought could be made as systematic as algebra or geometry. [ 31 ] Hobbes wrote in Leviathan : \"For reason ... is nothing but reckoning , that is adding and subtracting\". [ 32 ] Leibniz described a universal language of reasoning, the characteristica universalis , which would reduce argumentation to calculation so that \"there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants. For it would suffice to take their pencils in hand, down to their slates, and to say to each other (with a friend as witness, if they liked): Let us calculate .\" [ 33 ] The study of mathematical logic , such as Boole 's The Laws of Thought and Frege 's Begriffsschrift , have allowed for the scientific study of artificial intelligence. [ 34 ] Building on Frege's system, Russell and Whitehead presented a formal treatment of the foundations of mathematics in the Principia Mathematica in 1913. Following Russell, David Hilbert challenged mathematicians of the 1920s and 30s to formalize all mathematical reasoning . [ 35 ] This question has been addressed by Gödel 's incompleteness proof , [ 36 ] Turing 's machine [ 36 ] and Church 's Lambda calculus . [ a ] This work suggested that, within these limits, any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized. The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 , could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction. [ 36 ] The key insight was the Turing machine —a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation. [ 38 ] Computer science [ edit ] Main articles: History of computer hardware and History of computer science Calculating machines were designed or built in antiquity and throughout history by many people, including Gottfried Leibniz , [ 28 ] [ 39 ] Joseph Marie Jacquard , [ 40 ] Charles Babbage , [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Percy Ludgate , [ 42 ] Leonardo Torres Quevedo , [ 43 ] Vannevar Bush , [ 44 ] and others. Ada Lovelace speculated that Babbage's machine was \"a thinking or ... reasoning machine\", but warned \"It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that arise as to the powers\" of the machine. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] The first modern computers were the massive machines of the Second World War (such as Konrad Zuse 's Z3 , Tommy Flowers ' Heath Robinson and Colossus , Atanasoff and Berry 's ABC , and ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania ). [ 47 ] ENIAC was based on the theoretical foundation laid by Alan Turing and developed by John von Neumann , [ 48 ] and proved to be the most influential. [ 47 ] Birth of artificial intelligence (1941–1956) [ edit ] The IBM 702 : a computer used by the first generation of AI researchers. The earliest research into thinking machines was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener 's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon 's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing 's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that it might be possible to construct an \"electronic brain\". In the 1940s and 50s, a handful of scientists from a variety of fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) explored several research directions that would be vital to later AI research. [ 49 ] Alan Turing was among the first people to seriously investigate the theoretical possibility of \"machine intelligence\". [ 50 ] The field of \" artificial intelligence research \" was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. [ 51 ] Turing test [ 52 ] Turing test [ edit ] Main article: Turing test In 1950, Turing published a landmark paper, \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \", in which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines that think. [ 53 ] [ b ] In the paper, he noted that \"thinking\" is difficult to define and devised his famous Turing test : If a machine could carry on a conversation (over a teleprinter ) that was indistinguishable from a conversation with a human being, then it was reasonable to say that the machine was \"thinking\". [ 54 ] This simplified version of the problem allowed Turing to argue convincingly that a \"thinking machine\" was at least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition. [ 55 ] The Turing test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence . Artificial neural networks [ edit ] Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch analyzed networks of idealized artificial neurons and showed how they might perform simple logical functions in 1943. They were the first to describe what later researchers would call a neural network . [ 56 ] The paper was influenced by Turing's paper \" On Computable Numbers \" from 1936, using similar two-state boolean 'neurons', but was the first to apply it to neuronal function. [ 50 ] One of the students inspired by Pitts and McCulloch was Marvin Minsky who was a 24-year-old graduate student at the time. In 1951, Minsky and Dean Edmonds built the first neural net machine, the SNARC . [ 57 ] Minsky would later become one of the most important leaders and innovators in Artificial Intelligence. Cybernetic robots [ edit ] Experimental robots such as William Grey Walter 's turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast , were built in the 1950s. These machines did not use computers, digital electronics, or symbolic reasoning; they were controlled entirely by analog circuitry. [ 58 ] Game AI [ edit ] In 1951, using the Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the University of Manchester , Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers program [ 59 ] and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess. [ 60 ] Arthur Samuel 's checkers program, the subject of his 1959 paper \"Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers\", eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur. [ 61 ] Samuel's program was among the first uses of what would later be called machine learning . [ 62 ] Game AI would continue to be used as a measure of progress in AI throughout its history. Symbolic reasoning and the Logic Theorist [ edit ] Main article: Logic Theorist Herbert Simon (left) in a chess match against Allen Newell c. 1958 When access to digital computers became possible in the mid-fifties, a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could well be the essence of human thought. This was a new approach to creating thinking machines. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] In 1955, Allen Newell and future Nobel Laureate Herbert A. Simon created the \"Logic Theorist\", with help from J. C. Shaw . The program would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell and Whitehead 's Principia Mathematica , and find new and more elegant proofs for some. [ 65 ] Simon said that they had \"solved the venerable mind/body problem , explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind.\" [ 66 ] [ c ] The symbolic reasoning paradigm they introduced would dominate AI research and funding until the mid-90s, as well as inspire the cognitive revolution . Dartmouth Workshop [ edit ] Main article: Dartmouth workshop The Dartmouth workshop of 1956 was a pivotal event that marked the formal inception of AI as an academic discipline. [ 51 ] It was organized by Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy , with the support of two senior scientists Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester of IBM . The proposal for the conference stated they intended to test the assertion that \"every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\". [ 67 ] [ d ] The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was introduced by John McCarthy at the workshop. [ e ] The participants included Ray Solomonoff , Oliver Selfridge , Trenchard More , Arthur Samuel , Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon , all of whom would create important programs during the first decades of AI research. [ 73 ] [ f ] At the workshop, Newell and Simon debuted the \"Logic Theorist\". [ 74 ] The workshop was the moment that AI gained its name, its mission, its first major success and its key players, and is widely considered the birth of AI. [ g ] Cognitive revolution [ edit ] Main article: cognitive revolution In the autumn of 1956, Newell and Simon also presented the Logic Theorist at a meeting of the Special Interest Group in Information Theory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At the same meeting, Noam Chomsky discussed his generative grammar , and George Miller described his landmark paper \" The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two \". Miller wrote \"I left the symposium with a conviction, more intuitive than rational, that experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and the computer simulation of cognitive processes were all pieces from a larger whole.\" [ 76 ] [ 47 ] This meeting was the beginning of the \" cognitive revolution \"—an interdisciplinary paradigm shift in psychology, philosophy, computer science and neuroscience. It inspired the creation of the sub-fields of symbolic artificial intelligence , generative linguistics , cognitive science , cognitive psychology , cognitive neuroscience and the philosophical schools of computationalism and functionalism . All these fields used related tools to model the mind and results discovered in one field were relevant to the others. The cognitive approach allowed researchers to consider \"mental objects\" like thoughts, plans, goals, facts or memories, often analyzed using high level symbols in functional networks. These objects had been forbidden as \"unobservable\" by earlier paradigms such as behaviorism . [ h ] Symbolic mental objects would become the major focus of AI research and funding for the next several decades. Early successes (1956–1974) [ edit ] The programs developed in the years after the Dartmouth Workshop were, to most people, simply \"astonishing\": [ i ] computers were solving algebra word problems, proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak English. Few at the time would have believed that such \"intelligent\" behavior by machines was possible at all. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 79 ] Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years. [ 82 ] Government agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA, then known as \"ARPA\") poured money into the field. [ 83 ] Artificial Intelligence laboratories were set up at many British and US universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. [ 50 ] Stanisław Lem 's philosophical essay on \"intellectronics\" appeared in Lem's Summa Technologiae in 1964. [ 84 ] Approaches [ edit ] There were many successful programs and new directions in the late 50s and 1960s. Some of the most influential included: Reasoning, planning and problem solving as search [ edit ] Many early AI programs used the same basic algorithm . To achieve some goal (like winning a game or proving a theorem), they proceeded step by step towards it (by making a move or a deduction) as if searching through a maze, backtracking whenever they reached a dead end. [ 85 ] The principal difficulty was that, for many problems, the number of possible paths through the \"maze\" was astronomical (a situation known as a \" combinatorial explosion \"). Researchers would reduce the search space by using heuristics that would eliminate paths that were unlikely to lead to a solution. [ 86 ] Newell and Simon tried to capture a general version of this algorithm in a program called the \" General Problem Solver \". [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Other \"searching\" programs accomplished impressive results like solving problems in geometry and algebra, such as Herbert Gelernter 's Geometry Theorem Prover (1958) [ 89 ] and Symbolic Automatic Integrator (SAINT), written by Minsky's student James Slagle in 1961. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Other programs searched through goals and subgoals to plan actions , like the STRIPS system developed at Stanford to control the behavior of the robot Shakey . [ 92 ] Natural language [ edit ] An example of a semantic network An important goal of AI research is to allow computers to communicate in natural languages like English. An early success was Daniel Bobrow 's program STUDENT , which could solve high-school algebra word-problems. [ 93 ] A semantic net represents concepts (e.g., \"house\", \"door\") as nodes, and relations among concepts as links between the nodes (e.g. \"has-a\"). Ross Quillian wrote the first AI program to use a semantic net, [ 94 ] and the most successful (and controversial) version was Roger Schank 's Conceptual dependency theory . [ 95 ] Joseph Weizenbaum 's ELIZA could carry out conversations that were so realistic that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with a human being and not with a computer program (see ELIZA effect ). But in fact, ELIZA simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to it, rephrasing its response with a few grammar-rules. ELIZA was the first chatbot . [ 96 ] [ 97 ] Micro-worlds [ edit ] In the late 60s, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert of the MIT AI Laboratory proposed that AI research should focus on artificially simple situations known as micro-worlds. [ j ] They pointed out that in successful sciences like physics, basic principles were often best understood using simplified models like frictionless planes or perfectly rigid bodies. Much of the research focused on a \" blocks world \", which consists of colored blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface. [ 98 ] This paradigm led to innovative work in machine vision by Gerald Sussman , Adolfo Guzman, David Waltz (who invented \" constraint propagation \"), and especially Patrick Winston . At the same time, Minsky and Papert built a robot arm that could stack blocks, bringing the blocks world to life. Terry Winograd 's SHRDLU could communicate in ordinary English sentences about the micro-world, plan operations and execute them. [ 98 ] Perceptrons and early neural networks [ edit ] Main article: Perceptron In the 1960s, research-funders primarily supported laboratories researching symbolic AI , however, several people still pursued research in neural networks. The Mark 1 Perceptron The perceptron , a single-layer neural network was introduced in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt [ 99 ] (who had been a schoolmate of Marvin Minsky at the Bronx High School of Science ). [ 100 ] Like most AI researchers, he was optimistic about their power, predicting that a perceptron \"may eventually be able to learn, make decisions, and translate languages\". [ 101 ] Rosenblatt was primarily funded by the Office of Naval Research . [ 102 ] Bernard Widrow and his student Ted Hoff built ADALINE (1960) and MADALINE (1962), which had up to 1000 adjustable weights. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] A group at Stanford Research Institute led by Charles A. Rosen and Alfred E. (Ted) Brain built two neural-network machines named MINOS I (1960) and II (1963), mainly funded by the U.S. Army Signal Corps . MINOS II [ 105 ] had 6600 adjustable weights, [ 106 ] and was controlled with an SDS 910 computer in a configuration named MINOS III (1968), which could classify symbols on army maps, and recognize hand-printed characters on Fortran coding sheets . [ 107 ] [ 108 ] Most of neural-network research during this early period involved building and using bespoke hardware, rather than simulation on digital computers. [ k ] However, partly due to lack of results and partly due to competition from symbolic AI research, the MINOS project ran out of funding in 1966. Rosenblatt failed to secure continued funding in the 1960s. [ 109 ] In 1969, research came to a sudden halt with the publication of Minsky and Papert's 1969 book Perceptrons . [ 110 ] It suggested that there were severe limitations to what perceptrons could do and that Rosenblatt's predictions had been grossly exaggerated. The effect of the book was that virtually no research was funded in connectionism for 10 years. [ 111 ] The competition for government funding ended with the victory of symbolic AI approaches over neural networks. [ 108 ] [ 109 ] Minsky (who had worked on SNARC ) became a staunch objector to pure connectionist AI. Widrow (who had worked on ADALINE ) turned to adaptive signal processing. The SRI group (which worked on MINOS) turned to symbolic AI and robotics. [ 108 ] [ 109 ] The main problem was the inability to train multilayered networks (versions of backpropagation had already been used in other fields, but it was unknown to these researchers). [ 112 ] [ 111 ] The AI community became aware of backpropagation in the 1980s, [ 113 ] and, in the 21st century, neural networks would become enormously successful, fulfilling all of Rosenblatt's optimistic predictions. Rosenblatt did not live to see this, however, as he died in a boating accident in 1971. [ 114 ] Optimism [ edit ] The first generation of AI researchers made the following predictions about their work: 1958, H. A. Simon and Allen Newell : \"within ten years a digital computer will be the world's chess champion\" and \"within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem.\" [ 115 ] 1965, H. A. Simon: \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.\" [ 116 ] 1967, Marvin Minsky : \"Within a generation... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved.\" [ 117 ] 1970, Marvin Minsky (in Life magazine ): \"In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.\" [ 118 ] [ l ] Financing [ edit ] In June 1963, MIT received a $2.2 million grant from the newly formed Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later known as DARPA ). The money was used to fund project MAC which subsumed the \"AI Group\" founded by Minsky and McCarthy five years earlier. DARPA continued to provide $3 million each year until the 1970s. [ 121 ] DARPA made similar grants to Newell and Simon's program at Carnegie Mellon University and to Stanford University 's AI Lab , founded by John McCarthy in 1963. [ 122 ] Another important AI laboratory was established at Edinburgh University by Donald Michie in 1965. [ 123 ] These four institutions would continue to be the main centers of AI research and funding in academia for many years. [ 124 ] [ m ] The money was given with few strings attached: J. C. R. Licklider , then the director of ARPA, believed that his organization should \"fund people, not projects!\" and allowed researchers to pursue whatever directions might interest them. [ 126 ] This created a freewheeling atmosphere at MIT that gave birth to the hacker culture , [ 127 ] but this \"hands off\" approach did not last. First AI winter (1974–1980) [ edit ] In the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised public expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding targeted at AI was severely reduced. [ 128 ] The lack of success indicated that the techniques being used by AI researchers at the time were insufficient to achieve their goals. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] These setbacks did not affect the growth and progress of the field, however. The funding cuts only impacted a handful of major laboratories [ 131 ] and the critiques were largely ignored. [ 132 ] General public interest in the field continued to grow, [ 131 ] the number of researchers increased dramatically, [ 131 ] and new ideas were explored in logic programming , commonsense reasoning and many other areas. Historian Thomas Haigh argued in 2023 that there was no winter, [ 131 ] and AI researcher Nils Nilsson described this period as the most \"exciting\" time to work in AI. [ 133 ] Problems [ edit ] In the early seventies, the capabilities of AI programs were limited. Even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve; [ n ] all the programs were, in some sense, \"toys\". [ 135 ] AI researchers had begun to run into several limits that would be only conquered decades later, and others that still stymie the field in the 2020s: Limited computer power : There was not enough memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful. [ o ] For example: Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only 20 words, because that was all that would fit in memory. [ 137 ] Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power in the same way that aircraft require horsepower . Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power increases , eventually it could become easy. \"With enough horsepower,\" he wrote, \"anything will fly\". [ 138 ] [ p ] Intractability and the combinatorial explosion : In 1972 Richard Karp (building on Stephen Cook 's 1971 theorem ) showed there are many problems that can only be solved in exponential time . Finding optimal solutions to these problems requires extraordinary amounts of computer time, except when the problems are trivial. This limitation applied to all symbolic AI programs that used search trees and meant that many of the \"toy\" solutions used by AI would never scale to useful systems. [ 134 ] [ 130 ] Moravec's paradox : Early AI research had been very successful at getting computers to do \"intelligent\" tasks like proving theorems, solving geometry problems and playing chess. Their success at these intelligent tasks convinced them that the problem of intelligent behavior had been largely solved. [ 140 ] [ 141 ] However, they utterly failed to make progress on \"unintelligent\" tasks like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything. [ 140 ] [ 142 ] By the 1980s, researchers would realize that symbolic reasoning was utterly unsuited for these perceptual and sensorimotor tasks and that there were limits to this approach. [ 141 ] The breadth of commonsense knowledge : Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require enormous amounts of information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a vast amount of information with billions of atomic facts. No one in 1970 could build a database large enough and no one knew how a program might learn so much information. [ 143 ] Representing commonsense reasoning : Several related problems [ q ] appeared when researchers tried to represent commonsense reasoning using formal logic or symbols.  Descriptions of very ordinary deductions tended to get longer and longer the more one worked on them, as more and more exceptions, clarifications and distinctions were required. [ r ] However, when people thought about ordinary concepts, they did not rely on precise definitions, rather they seemed to make hundreds of imprecise assumptions, correcting them when necessary using their entire body of commonsense knowledge. Gerald Sussman observed that \"using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn't make them any more precise.\" [ 144 ] Decrease in funding [ edit ] See also: AI winter The agencies that funded AI research, such as the British government , DARPA and the National Research Council (NRC) became frustrated with the lack of progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected AI research. The pattern began in 1966 when the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report criticized machine translation efforts. After spending $20 million, the NRC ended all support. [ 145 ] In 1973, the Lighthill report on the state of AI research in the UK criticized the failure of AI to achieve its \"grandiose objectives\" and led to the dismantling of AI research in that country. [ 146 ] (The report specifically mentioned the combinatorial explosion problem as a reason for AI's failings.) [ 130 ] [ 134 ] [ s ] DARPA was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the Speech Understanding Research program at CMU and canceled an annual grant of $3 million. [ 148 ] [ t ] Hans Moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues. \"Many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration.\" [ 149 ] [ u ] However, there was another issue: since the passage of the Mansfield Amendment in 1969, DARPA had been under increasing pressure to fund \"mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research\". Funding for the creative, freewheeling exploration that had gone on in the 60s would not come from DARPA, which instead directed money at specific projects with clear objectives, such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems. [ 150 ] [ v ] The major laboratories (MIT, Stanford, CMU and Edinburgh) had been receiving generous support from their governments, and when it was withdrawn, these were the only places that were seriously impacted by the budget cuts. The thousands of researchers outside these institutions and the many thousands that were joining the field were unaffected. [ 131 ] Philosophical and ethical critiques [ edit ] See also: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Several philosophers had strong objections to the claims being made by AI researchers. One of the earliest was John Lucas , who argued that Gödel's incompleteness theorem showed that a formal system (such as a computer program) could never see the truth of certain statements, while a human being could. [ 152 ] Hubert Dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises of the 1960s and critiqued the assumptions of AI, arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little \"symbol processing\" and a great deal of embodied , instinctive , unconscious \" know how \". [ w ] [ 154 ] John Searle 's Chinese Room argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program could not be said to \"understand\" the symbols that it uses (a quality called \" intentionality \"). If the symbols have no meaning for the machine, Searle argued, then the machine can not be described as \"thinking\". [ 155 ] These critiques were not taken seriously by AI researchers. Problems like intractability and commonsense knowledge seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference \" know how \" or \" intentionality \" made to an actual computer program. MIT's Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle, \"they misunderstand, and should be ignored.\" [ 156 ] Dreyfus, who also taught at MIT , was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers \"dared not be seen having lunch with me.\" [ 157 ] Joseph Weizenbaum , the author of ELIZA , was also an outspoken critic of Dreyfus' positions, but he \"deliberately made it plain that [his AI colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus] was not the way to treat a human being,\" [ x ] and was unprofessional and childish. [ 159 ] Weizenbaum began to have serious ethical doubts about AI when Kenneth Colby wrote a \"computer program which can conduct psychotherapeutic dialogue\" based on ELIZA. [ 160 ] [ 161 ] [ y ] Weizenbaum was disturbed that Colby saw a mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool. A feud began, and the situation was not helped when Colby did not credit Weizenbaum for his contribution to the program. In 1976, Weizenbaum published Computer Power and Human Reason which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life. [ 163 ] MIT's \"anti-logic\" approach [ edit ] Among the critics of McCarthy's approach were his colleagues across the country at MIT . Marvin Minsky , Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like \"story understanding\" and \"object recognition\" that required a machine to think like a person. To use ordinary concepts like \"chair\" or \"restaurant\" they had to make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic. MIT chose instead to focus on writing programs that solved a given task without using high-level abstract definitions or general theories of cognition, and measured performance by iterative testing, rather than arguments from first principles. Schank described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as scruffy , as opposed to the neat paradigm used by McCarthy , Kowalski , Feigenbaum , Newell and Simon . [ 164 ] [ z ] In 1975, in a seminal paper, Minsky noted that many of his fellow researchers were using the same kind of tool: a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something. For example, if we use the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on (none of which are true for all birds). Minsky associated these assumptions with the general category and they could be inherited by the frames for subcategories and individuals, or over-ridden as necessary. He called these structures frames . Schank used a version of frames he called \" scripts \" to successfully answer questions about short stories in English. [ 165 ] Frames would eventually be widely used in software engineering under the name object-oriented programming . The logicians rose to the challenge. Pat Hayes claimed that \"most of 'frames' is just a new syntax for parts of first-order logic.\" But he noted that \"there are one or two apparently minor details which give a lot of trouble, however, especially defaults\". [ 166 ] Ray Reiter admitted that \"conventional logics, such as first-order logic, lack the expressive power to adequately represent the knowledge required for reasoning by default\". [ 167 ] He proposed augmenting first-order logic with a closed world assumption that a conclusion holds (by default) if its contrary cannot be shown. He showed how such an assumption corresponds to the common-sense assumption made in reasoning with frames. He also showed that it has its \"procedural equivalent\" as negation as failure in Prolog . The closed world assumption, as formulated by Reiter, \"is not a first-order notion. (It is a meta notion.)\" [ 167 ] However, Keith Clark showed that negation as finite failure can be understood as reasoning implicitly with definitions in first-order logic including a unique name assumption that different terms denote different individuals. [ 168 ] During the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, a variety of logics and extensions of first-order logic were developed both for negation as failure in logic programming and for default reasoning more generally. Collectively, these logics have become known as non-monotonic logics . Boom (1980–1987) [ edit ] In the 1980s, a form of AI program called \" expert systems \" was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. Governments provided substantial funding, such as Japan's fifth generation computer project and the U.S. Strategic Computing Initiative . \"Overall, the AI industry boomed from a few million dollars in 1980 to billions of dollars in 1988.\" [ 113 ] Expert systems become widely used [ edit ] An expert system is a program that answers questions or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. [ 169 ] The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral , begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. [ 170 ] [ 111 ] MYCIN , developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. [ 113 ] They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach. Expert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem) [ 111 ] and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place. All in all, the programs proved to be useful : something that AI had not been able to achieve up to this point. [ 171 ] In 1980, an expert system called R1 was completed at CMU for the Digital Equipment Corporation . It was an enormous success: it was saving the company 40 million dollars annually by 1986. [ 172 ] Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985, they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it in in-house AI departments. [ 173 ] An industry grew up to support them, including hardware companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines and software companies such as IntelliCorp and Aion . [ 174 ] Government funding increases [ edit ] In 1981, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside $850 million for the Fifth generation computer project. Their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations, translate languages, interpret pictures, and reason like human beings. [ 175 ] Much to the chagrin of scruffies , they initially chose Prolog as the primary computer language for the project. [ 176 ] Other countries responded with new programs of their own. The UK began the £350 million Alvey project. [ 177 ] A consortium of American companies formed the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (or \"MCC\") to fund large-scale projects in AI and information technology. [ 178 ] [ 177 ] DARPA responded as well, founding the Strategic Computing Initiative and tripling its investment in AI between 1984 and 1988. [ 179 ] [ 180 ] Knowledge revolution [ edit ] The power of expert systems came from the expert knowledge they contained. They were part of a new direction in AI research that had been gaining ground throughout the 70s. \"AI researchers were beginning to suspect—reluctantly, for it violated the scientific canon of parsimony —that intelligence might very well be based on the ability to use large amounts of diverse knowledge in different ways,\" [ 181 ] writes Pamela McCorduck . \"[T]he great lesson from the 1970s was that intelligent behavior depended very much on dealing with knowledge, sometimes quite detailed knowledge, of a domain where a given task lay\". [ 182 ] Knowledge based systems and knowledge engineering became a major focus of AI research in the 1980s. [ 183 ] It was hoped that vast databases would solve the commonsense knowledge problem and provide the support that commonsense reasoning required. In the 1980s, some researchers attempted to attack the commonsense knowledge problem directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows. Douglas Lenat , who started a database called Cyc , argued that there is no shortcut―the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand. [ 184 ] New directions in the 1980s [ edit ] Although symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning produced useful applications in the 80s and received massive amounts of funding, it was still unable to solve problems in perception , robotics , learning and common sense . A small number of scientists and engineers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would ever be sufficient for these tasks and developed other approaches, such as \" connectionism \", \"soft\" computing and reinforcement learning . Nils Nilsson called these approaches \"sub-symbolic\". Revival of neural networks: \"connectionism\" [ edit ] A Hopfield net with four nodes In 1982, physicist John Hopfield was able to prove that a form of neural network (now called a \" Hopfield net \") could learn and process information, and provably converges after enough time under any fixed condition. It was a breakthrough, as it was previously thought that nonlinear networks would, in general, evolve chaotically. [ 185 ] Geoffrey Hinton proved a similar result about a device called a \" Boltzmann machine \". [ 186 ] (Hopfield and Hinton would eventually receive the 2024 Nobel prize for this work. [ 186 ] ) In 1986, Hinton and David Rumelhart popularized a method for training neural networks called \" backpropagation \". [ aa ] These three developments helped to revive the exploration of artificial neural networks . [ 113 ] [ 187 ] Neural networks, along with several other similar models, received widespread attention after the 1986 publication of the Parallel Distributed Processing , a two-volume collection of papers edited by Rumelhart and psychologist James McClelland . The new field was christened \" connectionism \" and there was a considerable debate between advocates of symbolic AI and the \"connectionists\". [ 113 ] Hinton called symbols the \" luminous aether of AI\"―that is, an unworkable and misleading model of intelligence. [ 113 ] This was a direct attack on the principles that inspired the cognitive revolution . Neural networks started to advance the state of the art in some specialist areas such as protein structure prediction. Following pioneering work from Terry Sejnowski, [ 188 ] cascading multilayer perceptrons such as PhD [ 189 ] and PsiPred [ 190 ] reached near-theoretical maximum accuracy in predicting secondary structure. In 1990, Yann LeCun at Bell Labs used convolutional neural networks to recognize handwritten digits. The system was used widely in the 90s, reading zip codes and personal checks. This was the first genuinely useful application of neural networks. [ 191 ] [ 192 ] Robotics and embodied reason [ edit ] Main articles: Nouvelle AI , behavior-based AI , situated AI , and embodied cognitive science Rodney Brooks , Hans Moravec and others argued that, to show real intelligence, a machine needs to have a body —it needs to perceive, move, survive, and deal with the world. [ 193 ] Sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills such as commonsense reasoning . They can't be efficiently implemented using abstract symbolic reasoning, so AI should solve the problems of perception, mobility, manipulation and survival without using symbolic representation at all. These robotics researchers advocated building intelligence \"from the bottom up\". [ ab ] A precursor to this idea was David Marr , who had come to MIT in the late 1970s from a successful background in theoretical neuroscience to lead the group studying vision . He rejected all symbolic approaches ( both McCarthy's logic and Minsky 's frames), arguing that AI needed to understand the physical machinery of vision from the bottom up before any symbolic processing took place. (Marr's work would be cut short by leukemia in 1980.) [ 195 ] In his 1990 paper \"Elephants Don't Play Chess\", [ 196 ] robotics researcher Brooks took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis , arguing that symbols are not always necessary since \"the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail there is to be known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough.\" [ 197 ] In the 1980s and 1990s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the \" embodied mind thesis\". [ 198 ] Soft computing and probabilistic reasoning [ edit ] Soft computing uses methods that work with incomplete and imprecise information. They do not attempt to give precise, logical answers, but give results that are only \"probably\" correct. This allowed them to solve problems that precise symbolic methods could not handle. Press accounts often claimed these tools could \"think like a human\". [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Judea Pearl 's Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference , an influential 1988 book [ 201 ] brought probability and decision theory into AI. [ 202 ] Fuzzy logic , developed by Lofti Zadeh in the 60s, began to be more widely used in AI and robotics. Evolutionary computation and artificial neural networks also handle imprecise information, and are classified as \"soft\". In the 90s and early 2000s many other soft computing tools were developed and put into use, including Bayesian networks , [ 202 ] hidden Markov models , [ 202 ] information theory , and stochastic modeling . These tools, in turn depended on advanced mathematical techniques such as classical optimization . For a time in the 1990s and early 2000s, these soft tools were studied by a subfield of AI called \" computational intelligence \". [ 203 ] Reinforcement learning [ edit ] Reinforcement learning [ 204 ] rewards an agent every time it performs a desired action well, and may give negative rewards (or \"punishments\") when it performs poorly. It was described in the first half of the twentieth century by psychologists using animal models, such as Thorndike , [ 205 ] [ 206 ] Pavlov [ 207 ] and Skinner . [ 208 ] In the 1950s, Alan Turing [ 206 ] [ 209 ] and Arthur Samuel [ 206 ] foresaw the role of reinforcement learning in AI. A successful and influential research program was led by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto beginning in 1972. Their collaboration revolutionized the study of reinforcement learning and decision making over the past four decades. [ 210 ] [ 211 ] In 1988, Sutton described machine learning in terms of decision theory (i.e., the Markov decision process ). This gave the subject a solid theoretical foundation and access to a large body of theoretical results developed in the field of operations research . [ 211 ] Also in 1988, Sutton and Barto developed the \" temporal difference \" (TD) learning algorithm, where the agent is rewarded only when its predictions show improvement. It significantly outperformed previous algorithms. [ 212 ] TD-learning was used by Gerald Tesauro in 1992 in the program TD-Gammon , which played backgammon as well as the best human players. The program learned the game by playing against itself with zero prior knowledge. [ 213 ] In an interesting case of interdisciplinary convergence, neurologists discovered in 1997 that the dopamine reward system in brains also uses a version of the TD-learning algorithm. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ] TD learning would be become highly influential in the 21st century, used in both AlphaGo and AlphaZero . [ 217 ] Second AI winter (1990s) [ edit ] The business community's fascination with AI rose and fell in the 1980s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble . As dozens of companies failed, the perception in the business world was that the technology was not viable. [ 218 ] The damage to AI's reputation would last into the 21st century. Inside the field, there was little agreement on the reasons for AI's failure to fulfill the dream of human-level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the 1960s. Together, all these factors helped to fragment AI into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches, sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of \"artificial intelligence\". [ 219 ] Over the next 20 years, AI consistently delivered working solutions to specific isolated problems. By the late 1990s, it was being used throughout the technology industry, although somewhat behind the scenes. The success was due to increasing computer power , by collaboration with other fields (such as mathematical optimization and statistics ) and using higher standards of scientific accountability. AI winter [ edit ] The term \" AI winter \" was coined by researchers who had survived the funding cuts of 1974 when they became concerned that enthusiasm for expert systems had spiraled out of control and that disappointment would certainly follow. [ ac ] Their fears were well founded: in the late 1980s and early 1990s, AI suffered a series of financial setbacks. [ 113 ] The first indication of a change in weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987, they became more powerful than the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight. [ 221 ] Eventually, the earliest successful expert systems, such as XCON , proved too expensive to maintain. They were difficult to update, they could not learn, and they were \" brittle \" (i.e., they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs). Expert systems proved useful, but only in a few special contexts. [ 222 ] In the late 1980s, the Strategic Computing Initiative cut funding to AI \"deeply and brutally\". New leadership at DARPA had decided that AI was not \"the next wave\" and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results. [ 223 ] By 1991, the impressive list of goals penned in 1981 for Japan's Fifth Generation Project had not been met. Some of them, like \"carry on a casual conversation\", would not be accomplished for another 30 years. As with other AI projects, expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible. [ 224 ] [ ad ] Over 300 AI companies had shut down, gone bankrupt, or been acquired by the end of 1993, effectively ending the first commercial wave of AI. [ 226 ] In 1994, HP Newquist stated in The Brain Makers that \"The immediate future of artificial intelligence—in its commercial form—seems to rest in part on the continued success of neural networks.\" [ 226 ] AI behind the scenes [ edit ] In the 1990s, algorithms originally developed by AI researchers began to appear as parts of larger systems. AI had solved a lot of very difficult problems [ ae ] and their solutions proved to be useful throughout the technology industry, [ 227 ] [ 228 ] such as data mining , industrial robotics , logistics, speech recognition , [ 229 ] banking software, [ 230 ] medical diagnosis, [ 230 ] and Google 's search engine. [ 231 ] [ 232 ] The field of AI received little or no credit for these successes in the 1990s and early 2000s. Many of AI's greatest innovations have been reduced to the status of just another item in the tool chest of computer science. [ 233 ] Nick Bostrom explains: \"A lot of cutting-edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\" [ 230 ] Many researchers in AI in the 1990s deliberately called their work by other names, such as informatics , knowledge-based systems , \"cognitive systems\" or computational intelligence . In part, this may have been because they considered their field to be fundamentally different from AI, but also the new names helped to procure funding. [ 229 ] [ 234 ] [ 235 ] In the commercial world at least, the failed promises of the AI winter continued to haunt AI research into the 2000s, as the New York Times reported in 2005: \"Computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers.\" [ 236 ] Mathematical rigor, greater collaboration, and a narrow focus [ edit ] AI researchers began to develop and use sophisticated mathematical tools more than they ever had in the past. [ 237 ] [ 238 ] Most of the new directions in AI relied heavily on mathematical models, including artificial neural networks , probabilistic reasoning , soft computing and reinforcement learning . In the 90s and 2000s, many other highly mathematical tools were adapted for AI. These tools were applied to machine learning, perception, and mobility. There was a widespread realization that many of the problems that AI needed to solve were already being worked on by researchers in fields like statistics , mathematics , electrical engineering , economics , or operations research . The shared mathematical language allowed both a higher level of collaboration with more established and successful fields and the achievement of results that were measurable and provable; AI had become a more rigorous \"scientific\" discipline. Another key reason for the success in the 90s was that AI researchers focused on specific problems with verifiable solutions (an approach later derided as narrow AI ). This provided useful tools in the present, rather than speculation about the future. Intelligent agents [ edit ] A new paradigm called \" intelligent agents \" became widely accepted during the 1990s. [ 239 ] [ 240 ] [ af ] Although earlier researchers had proposed modular \"divide and conquer\" approaches to AI, [ ag ] the intelligent agent did not reach its modern form until Judea Pearl , Allen Newell , Leslie P. Kaelbling , and others brought concepts from decision theory and economics into the study of AI. [ 241 ] When the economist's definition of a rational agent was married to computer science 's definition of an object or module , the intelligent agent paradigm was complete. An intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. By this definition, simple programs that solve specific problems are \"intelligent agents\", as are human beings and organizations of human beings, such as firms . The intelligent agent paradigm defines AI research as \"the study of intelligent agents\". [ ah ] This is a generalization of some earlier definitions of AI: it goes beyond studying human intelligence; it studies all kinds of intelligence. The paradigm gave researchers license to study isolated problems and to disagree about methods, but still retain hope that their work could be combined into an agent architecture that would be capable of general intelligence. [ 242 ] Milestones and Moore's law [ edit ] On 11 May 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov . [ 243 ] In 2005, a Stanford robot won the DARPA Grand Challenge by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail. Two years later, a team from CMU won the DARPA Urban Challenge by autonomously navigating 55 miles in an urban environment while responding to traffic hazards and adhering to traffic laws. [ 244 ] These successes were not due to some revolutionary new paradigm, but mostly to the tedious application of engineering skill and to the tremendous increase in the speed and capacity of computers by the 90s. [ ai ] In fact, Deep Blue's computer was 10 million times faster than the Ferranti Mark 1 that Christopher Strachey taught to play chess in 1951. [ aj ] This dramatic increase is measured by Moore's law , which predicts that the speed and memory capacity of computers double every two years. The fundamental problem of \"raw computer power\" was slowly being overcome. Arts and literature influenced by AI [ edit ] Electronic literature experiments such as The Impermanence Agent (1998–2002) and digital art such as Agent Ruby used AI in their art and literature, \"laying bare the bias accompanying forms of technology that feign objectivity.\" [ 248 ] Big data, deep learning, AGI (2005–2017) [ edit ] In the first decades of the 21st century, access to large amounts of data (known as \" big data \"), cheaper and faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy. A turning point was the success of deep learning around 2012, which improved the performance of machine learning on many tasks, including image and video processing, text analysis, and speech recognition. [ 249 ] Investment in AI increased along with its capabilities, and by 2016, the market for AI-related products, hardware, and software reached more than $8 billion, and the New York Times reported that interest in AI had reached a \"frenzy\". [ 250 ] In 2002, Ben Goertzel and others became concerned that AI had largely abandoned its original goal of producing versatile, fully intelligent machines, and argued in favor of more direct research into artificial general intelligence (AGI). By the mid-2010s, several companies and institutions had been founded to pursue artificial general intelligence, such as OpenAI and Google 's DeepMind . During the same period, new insights into superintelligence raised concerns that AI was an existential threat . The risks and unintended consequences of AI technology became an area of serious academic research after 2016. Big data and big machines [ edit ] See also: List of datasets for machine-learning research The success of machine learning in the 2000s depended on the availability of vast amounts of training data and faster computers. [ 251 ] Russell and Norvig wrote that the \"improvement in performance obtained by increasing the size of the data set by two or three orders of magnitude outweighs any improvement that can be made by tweaking the algorithm.\" [ 191 ] Geoffrey Hinton recalled that back in the 80s and 90s, the problem was that \"our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small. [And] our computers were millions of times too slow.\" [ 252 ] This was no longer true by 2010. The most useful data in the 2000s came from curated, labeled data sets created specifically for machine learning and AI. In 2007, a group at UMass Amherst released \"Labeled Faces in the Wild\", an annotated set of images of faces that was widely used to train and test face recognition systems for the next several decades. [ 253 ] Fei-Fei Li developed ImageNet , a database of three million images captioned by volunteers using the Amazon Mechanical Turk . Released in 2009, it was a useful body of training data and a benchmark for testing for the next generation of image processing systems. [ 254 ] [ 191 ] Google released word2vec in 2013 as an open source resource. It used large amounts of data text scraped from the internet and word embedding to create a numeric vector to represent each word. Users were surprised at how well it was able to capture word meanings, for example, ordinary vector addition would give equivalences like China + River = Yangtze or London − England + France = Paris. [ 255 ] This database in particular would be essential for the development of large language models in the late 2010s. The explosive growth of the internet gave machine learning programs access to billions of pages of text and images that could be scraped . And, for specific problems, large privately held databases contained the relevant data. McKinsey Global Institute reported that \"by 2009, nearly all sectors in the US economy had at least an average of 200 terabytes of stored data\". [ 256 ] This collection of information was known in the 2000s as big data . In a Jeopardy! exhibition match in February 2011, IBM 's question answering system Watson defeated the two best Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings , by a significant margin. [ 257 ] Watson's expertise would have been impossible without the information available on the internet. [ 191 ] Deep learning [ edit ] Main article: Deep learning In 2012, AlexNet , a deep learning model, [ ak ] developed by Alex Krizhevsky , won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge , with significantly fewer errors than the second-place winner. [ 259 ] [ 191 ] Krizhevsky worked with Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto . [ al ] This was a turning point in machine learning: over the next few years, dozens of other approaches to image recognition were abandoned in favor of deep learning. [ 251 ] Deep learning uses a multi-layer perceptron . Although this architecture has been known since the 60s, getting it to work requires powerful hardware and large amounts of training data. [ 260 ] Before these became available, improving the performance of image processing systems required hand-crafted ad hoc features that were difficult to implement. [ 260 ] Deep learning was simpler and more general. [ am ] Deep learning was applied to dozens of problems over the next few years (such as speech recognition, machine translation, medical diagnosis, and game playing). In every case, it showed enormous gains in performance. [ 251 ] Investment and interest in AI boomed as a result. [ 251 ] The alignment problem [ edit ] Main article: AI alignment It became fashionable in the 2000s to begin talking about the future of AI again and several popular books considered the possibility of superintelligent machines and what they might mean for human society. Some of this was optimistic (such as Ray Kurzweil 's The Singularity is Near ), but others warned that a sufficiently powerful AI was existential threat to humanity, such as Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky . [ 261 ] The topic became widely covered in the press and many leading intellectuals and politicians commented on the issue. AI programs in the 21st century are defined by their goals —the specific measures that they are designed to optimize. Nick Bostrom 's influential 2014 book Superintelligence [ 262 ] argued that, if one isn't careful about defining these goals, the machine may cause harm to humanity in the process of achieving a goal. Stuart J. Russell used the example of an intelligent robot that kills its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead\". [ 263 ] (This problem is known by the technical term \" instrumental convergence \".) The solution is to align the machine's goal function with the goals of its owner and humanity in general. Thus, the problem of mitigating the risks and unintended consequences of AI became known as \"the value alignment problem\" or AI alignment. [ 264 ] At the same time, machine learning systems had begun to have disturbing unintended consequences. Cathy O'Neil explained how statistical algorithms had been among the causes of the 2008 economic crash , [ 265 ] Julia Angwin of ProPublica argued that the COMPAS system used by the criminal justice system exhibited racial bias under some measures, [ 266 ] [ an ] others showed that many machine learning systems exhibited some form of racial bias , [ 268 ] and there were many other examples of dangerous outcomes that had resulted from machine learning systems. [ ao ] In 2016, the election of Donald Trump and the controversy over the COMPAS system illuminated several problems with the current technological infrastructure, including misinformation, social media algorithms designed to maximize engagement, the misuse of personal data and the trustworthiness of predictive models. [ 269 ] Issues of fairness and unintended consequences became significantly more popular at AI conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers refocused their careers on these issues. The value alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. [ 270 ] [ ap ] Artificial general intelligence research [ edit ] In the early 2000s, several researchers became concerned that mainstream AI was too focused on \"measurable performance in specific applications\" [ 272 ] (known as \" narrow AI \") and had abandoned AI's original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. An early critic was Nils Nilsson in 1995, and similar opinions were published by AI elder statesmen John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Patrick Winston in 2007–2009. Minsky organized a symposium on \"human-level AI\" in 2004. [ 272 ] Ben Goertzel adopted the term \" artificial general intelligence \" for the new sub-field, founding a journal and holding conferences beginning in 2008. [ 273 ] The new field grew rapidly, buoyed by the continuing success of artificial neural networks and the hope that it was the key to AGI. Several competing companies, laboratories and foundations were founded to develop AGI in the 2010s. DeepMind was founded in 2010 by three English scientists, Demis Hassabis , Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman , with funding from Peter Thiel and later Elon Musk . The founders and financiers were deeply concerned about AI safety and the existential risk of AI . DeepMind's founders had a personal connection with Yudkowsky, and Musk was among those who were actively raising the alarm. [ 274 ] Hassabis was both worried about the dangers of AGI and optimistic about its power; he hoped they could \"solve AI, then solve everything else.\" [ 275 ] The New York Times wrote in 2023, \"At the heart of this competition is a brain-stretching paradox. The people who say they are most worried about AI are among the most determined to create it and enjoy its riches. They have justified their ambition with their strong belief that they alone can keep AI from endangering Earth.\" [ 274 ] In 2012, Geoffrey Hinton (who had been leading neural network research since the 80s) was approached by Baidu , which wanted to hire him and all his students for an enormous sum. Hinton decided to hold an auction and, at a Lake Tahoe AI conference, they sold themselves to Google for a price of $44 million. Hassabis took notice and sold DeepMind to Google in 2014, on the condition that it would not accept military contracts and would be overseen by an ethics board. [ 274 ] Sam Altman , the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI Larry Page of Google, unlike Musk and Hassabis, was an optimist about the future of AI. Musk and Page became embroiled in an argument about the risk of AGI at Musk's 2015 birthday party. They had been friends for decades, but stopped speaking to each other shortly afterwards. Musk attended the only meeting of DeepMind's ethics board, where it became clear that Google was uninterested in mitigating the harm of AGI. Frustrated by his lack of influence, he founded OpenAI in 2015, enlisting Sam Altman to run it and hiring top scientists. OpenAI began as a non-profit, \"free from the economic incentives that were driving Google and other corporations.\" [ 274 ] Musk became frustrated again and left the company in 2018. OpenAI turned to Microsoft for continued financial support and Altman and OpenAI formed a for-profit version of the company with more than $1 billion in financing. [ 274 ] In 2021, Dario Amodei and 14 other scientists left OpenAI over concerns that the company was putting profits above safety. They formed Anthropic , which soon had $6 billion in financing from Microsoft and Google. [ 274 ] Large language models, AI boom (2017–present) [ edit ] Main article: AI boom In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [ 276 ] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [ 276 ] The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022. The AI boom started with the initial development of key architectures and algorithms such as the transformer architecture in 2017, leading to the scaling and development of large language models exhibiting human-like traits of knowledge, attention, and creativity. The new AI era began in 2020, with the public release of a scaled large language model (LLM) GPT-3, the predecessor of ChatGPT . [ 277 ] Transformer architecture and large language models [ edit ] Main article: Large language models In 2017, the transformer architecture was proposed by Google researchers in a paper titled \" Attention Is All You Need \". It exploits a self-attention mechanism and became widely used in large language models. [ 278 ] Large language models, based on the transformer, were further developed by other companies: OpenAI released GPT-3 in 2020, then DeepMind released Gato in 2022. These are foundation models : they are trained on vast quantities of unlabeled data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks. These models can discuss a huge number of topics and display general knowledge, which has raised questions around whether or not they are examples of artificial general intelligence . Bill Gates was skeptical of the new technology and the hype that surrounded AGI. However, Altman presented him with a live demo of ChatGPT-4 passing an advanced biology test. Gates was convinced. [ 274 ] In 2023, Microsoft Research tested the model with a large variety of tasks, and concluded that \"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\". [ 279 ] In 2024, OpenAI o3 , a type of advanced reasoning model developed by OpenAI, was announced. On the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmark developed by François Chollet in 2019, the model achieved an unofficial score of 87.5% on the semi-private test, surpassing the typical human score of 84%. The benchmark is supposed to be a necessary, but not sufficient, test for AGI. Speaking of the benchmark, Chollet has said, \"You'll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.\" [ 280 ] Investment in AI [ edit ] Investment in AI grew exponentially after 2020, with venture capital funding for generative AI companies increasing dramatically. Total AI investments rose from $18 billion in 2014 to $119 billion in 2021, with generative AI accounting for approximately 30% of investments by 2023. [ 281 ] According to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the United States outranked the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding , number of startups , and AI patents granted. [ 282 ] The commercial AI scene became dominated by American Big Tech companies, whose investments in this area surpassed those from U.S.-based venture capitalists . [ 283 ] OpenAI 's valuation reached $86 billion by early 2024, [ 284 ] while NVIDIA 's market capitalization surpassed $3.3 trillion by mid-2024, making it the world's largest company by market capitalization as the demand for AI-capable GPUs surged. [ 285 ] Advent of AI for public use [ edit ] 15.ai , launched in March 2020 [ 286 ] by an anonymous MIT researcher, [ 287 ] [ 288 ] was one of the earliest examples of generative AI gaining widespread public attention during the initial stages of the AI boom. [ 289 ] The free web application demonstrated the ability to clone character voices using neural networks with minimal training data, requiring as little as 15 seconds of audio to reproduce a voice—a capability later corroborated by OpenAI in 2024. [ 290 ] The service went viral on social media platforms in early 2021, [ 291 ] [ 292 ] allowing users to generate speech for characters from popular media franchises, and became particularly notable for its pioneering role in popularizing AI voice synthesis for creative content and memes . [ 293 ] Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable. This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system's potential effects. OpenAI's recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence states that \"At some point, it may be important to get an independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models.\" We agree. That point is now. Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4 . This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium. Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter [ 294 ] ChatGPT was launched on 30 November 2022, marking a pivotal moment in artificial intelligence's public adoption. Within days of its release it went viral, gaining over 100 million users in two months and becoming the fastest-growing consumer software application in history. [ 295 ] The chatbot's ability to engage in human-like conversations, write code, and generate creative content captured public imagination and led to rapid adoption across various sectors including education , business , and research. [ 296 ] ChatGPT's success prompted unprecedented responses from major technology companies— Google declared a \"code red\" and rapidly launched Gemini (formerly known as Google Bard), while Microsoft incorporated the technology into Bing Chat . [ 297 ] The rapid adoption of these AI technologies sparked intense debate about their implications. Notable AI researchers and industry leaders voiced both optimism and concern about the accelerating pace of development. In March 2023, over 20,000 signatories, including computer scientist Yoshua Bengio , Elon Musk , and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak , signed an open letter calling for a pause in advanced AI development , citing \" profound risks to society and humanity .\" [ 298 ] However, other prominent researchers like Juergen Schmidhuber took a more optimistic view, emphasizing that the majority of AI research aims to make \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" [ 299 ] By mid-2024, however, the financial sector began to scrutinize AI companies more closely, particularly questioning their capacity to produce a return on investment commensurate with their massive valuations. Some prominent investors raised concerns about market expectations becoming disconnected from fundamental business realities. Jeremy Grantham , co-founder of GMO LLC , warned investors to \"be quite careful\" and drew parallels to previous technology-driven market bubbles. [ 300 ] Similarly, Jeffrey Gundlach , CEO of DoubleLine Capital , explicitly compared the AI boom to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, suggesting that investor enthusiasm might be outpacing realistic near-term capabilities and revenue potential. [ 301 ] These concerns were amplified by the substantial market capitalizations of AI-focused companies, many of which had yet to demonstrate sustainable profitability models. In March 2024, Anthropic released the Claude 3 family of large language models, including Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. [ 302 ] The models demonstrated significant improvements in capabilities across various benchmarks, with Claude 3 Opus notably outperforming leading models from OpenAI and Google. [ 303 ] In June 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which demonstrated improved performance compared to the larger Claude 3 Opus, particularly in areas such as coding, multistep workflows, and image analysis. [ 304 ] 2024 Nobel Prizes [ edit ] In 2024, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Nobel Prizes in recognition of groundbreaking contributions to artificial intelligence . The recipients included: In physics: John Hopfield for his work on physics-inspired Hopfield networks , and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational contributions to Boltzmann machines and deep learning . In chemistry: David Baker , Demis Hassabis , and John Jumper for their advancements in protein folding predictions . See AlphaFold . [ 305 ] Further study and development of AI [ edit ] In January 2025, OpenAI announced a new AI, ChatGPT-Gov, which would be specifically designed for US government agencies to use securely. [ 306 ] Open AI said that agencies could utilize ChatGPT Gov on a Microsoft Azure cloud or Azure Government cloud, \"on top of Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service.\" OpenAI's announcement stated that \"Self-hosting ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance requirements, such as stringent cybersecurity frameworks (IL5, CJIS, ITAR, FedRAMP High). Additionally, we believe this infrastructure will expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\" [ 306 ] National policies [ edit ] Countries have invested in policies and funding to deploy autonomous robots in an attempt to address labor shortages and enhance efficiency, while also implementing regulatory frameworks for ethical and safe development. China [ edit ] In 2025, China invested approximately 730 billion yuan (roughly US$100 billion) to advance AI and robotics in smart manufacturing and healthcare. [ 307 ] The \"14th Five-Year Plan\" (2021–2025) prioritized service robots, with AI systems enabling robots to perform complex tasks like assisting in surgeries or automating factory assembly lines. [ 308 ] Some funding also supported defense applications, such as autonomous drones. [ 309 ] [ 310 ] Starting in September 2025, China mandated labeling of AI-generated content to ensure transparency and public trust in these technologies. [ 311 ] United States [ edit ] In January 2025, Stargate LLC was formed as a joint venture of OpenAI , SoftBank , Oracle , and MGX , who announced plans to invest US$500 billion in AI infrastructure in the United States by 2029. The venture was formally announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on 21 January 2025, with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son appointed as chairman. [ 312 ] [ 313 ] The U.S. government allocated approximately $2 billion to integrate AI and robotics in manufacturing and logistics. [ 314 ] [ non-primary source needed ] State governments supplemented this with funding for service robots, such as those deployed in warehouses to fulfill verbal commands for inventory management or in eldercare facilities to respond to residents' requests for assistance. [ 315 ] Some funds were directed to defense, including lethal autonomous weapon and military robots . In January 2025, Executive Order 14179 established an \"AI Action Plan\" to accelerate innovation and deployment of these technologies with the declared intent of \"world domination\" and \"victory\".

[ 37 ] ^ Alan Turing was thinking about machine intelligence at least as early as 1941, when he circulated a paper on machine intelligence which could be the earliest paper in the field of AI — although it is now lost. His 1950 paper was followed by three radio broadcasts on AI by Turing, the two lectures 'Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory' and 'Can Digital Computers Think?' and the panel discussion 'Can Automatic Calculating Machines be Said to Think?' [ 50 ] ^ This was an early statement of the philosophical position John Searle would later call the \" Strong AI hypothesis \": that machines can contain minds just as human bodies do. ^ Daniel Crevier wrote \"[the proposal] later became known as the 'physical symbol systems hypothesis'\". [ 68 ] The physical symbol system hypothesis was articulated and named by Newell and Simon in their paper on GPS . [ 69 ] It includes a more specific definition of a \"machine\" as an agent that manipulates symbols. ^ \"I won't swear and I hadn't seen it before,\" McCarthy told Pamela McCorduck in 1979. [ 70 ] However, McCarthy also stated unequivocally \"I came up with the term\" in a CNET interview. [ 71 ] The term was chosen by McCarthy to avoid associations with cybernetics and the influence of Norbert Wiener . \"[O]ne of the reasons for inventing the term \"artificial intelligence\" was to escape association with \"cybernetics\". Its concentration on analog feedback seemed misguided, and I wished to avoid having either to accept Norbert (not Robert) Wiener as a guru or having to argue with him.\". [ 72 ] ^ Pamela McCorduck discusses how the Dartmouth conference alumni dominated the first two decades of AI research, calling them the \"invisible college\". [ 73 ] ^ Daniel Crevier wrote \"the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science.\" [ 75 ] ^ There were a few psychologists who avoided behaviorism and embraced a cognitive approach before it was fashionable, such as Frederic Bartlett and Kenneth Craig [ 77 ] ^ Russell and Norvig wrote that \"it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything remotely clever\". [ 78 ] AI-founder John McCarthy called this the \"Look, Ma, no hands!\" era. [ 79 ] ^ This avoided the commonsense knowledge problem, discussed below. ^ The hardware diversity was particularly clear in the different technologies used in implementing the adjustable weights. The perceptron machines and the SNARC used potentiometers moved by electric motors. ADALINE used memistors adjusted by electroplating , though they also used simulations on an IBM 1620 computer. The MINOS machines used ferrite cores with multiple holes in them that could be individually blocked, with the degree of blockage representing the weights. [ 109 ] ^ Minsky strongly believes he was misquoted. [ 119 ] [ 120 ] ^ McCorduck also notes that funding was mostly under the direction of alumni of the Dartmouth workshop of 1956. [ 125 ] ^ Russell and Norvig wrote \"in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult tasks.\" [ 134 ] ^ Bruce Buchanan wrote: \"Early programs were necessarily limited in scope by the size and speed of memory\" [ 136 ] ^ History would prove Moravec right about applications like computer vision. Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of the human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 1000 million instructions per second (MIPS). In 1976, the fastest supercomputer, the $8 million Cray-1 was only capable of 130 MIPS, and a typical desktop computer had 1 MIPS. As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS. [ 139 ] ^ Such as the frame , ramification and qualification problems , as well as the difficulty of default reasoning and word-sense disambiguation . ^ Russell and Norvig write: \"[M]any of the concepts we name in language fail, on closer inspection, to have the logically defined necessary and sufficient conditions that early AI researchers hoped to capture in axiomatic form.\" [ 113 ] ^ John McCarthy wrote in response that \"the combinatorial explosion problem has been recognized in AI from the beginning\" [ 147 ] ^ This account is based on Crevier 1993 , pp. 115–116. Other views include McCorduck 2004 , pp. 306–313 and NRC 1999 under \"Success in Speech Recognition\". ^ Moravec explains, \"Their initial promises to DARPA had been much too optimistic. Of course, what they delivered stopped considerably short of that. But they felt they couldn't in their next proposal promise less than in the first one, so they promised more.\" [ 149 ] ^ While the autonomous tank was a failure, the battle management system (called \" DART \") proved to be enormously successful, saving billions in the first Gulf War , repaying the investment and justifying the DARPA 's pragmatic policy, at least as far as DARPA was concerned. [ 151 ] ^ \"Know-how\" is Dreyfus' term. Dreyfus makes a distinction between \"knowing how\" and \"knowing that\", a modern version of Heidegger 's distinction of ready-to-hand and present-at-hand . [ 153 ] ^ Weizenbaum said: \"I became the only member of the AI community to be seen eating lunch with Dreyfus. And I deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being.\" [ 158 ] ^ Colby and his colleagues later also developed chatterbot -like \"computer simulations of paranoid processes ( PARRY )\" to \"make intelligible paranoid processes in explicit symbol processing terms.\" [ 162 ] ^ Another aspect of the conflict was called \"the procedural/declarative distinction\" but did not prove to be influential in later AI research. ^ Versions of backpropagation had been developed in several fields, most directly as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by Seppo Linnainmaa (1970). It was applied to neural networks in the 1970s by Paul Werbos . [ 112 ] ^ Hans Moravec wrote: \"I am confident that this bottom-up route to artificial intelligence will one date meet the traditional top-down route more than half way, ready to provide the real world competence and the commonsense knowledge that has been so frustratingly elusive in reasoning programs. Fully intelligent machines will result when the metaphorical golden spike is driven, uniting the two efforts.\" [ 194 ] ^ AI winter was first used as the title of a seminar on the subject for the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence . [ 220 ] ^ McCorduck writes \"Two and a half decades later, we can see that the Japanese didn't quite meet all of those ambitious goals.\" [ 225 ] ^ See Applications of artificial intelligence § Computer science ^ Russell and Norvig wrote \"The whole-agent view is now widely accepted.\" [ 241 ] ^ Carl Hewitt 's Actor model anticipated the modern definition of intelligent agents. ( Hewitt, Bishop & Steiger 1973 ) Both John Doyle ( Doyle 1983 ) and Marvin Minsky 's popular classic The Society of Mind ( Minsky 1986 ) used the word \"agent\". Other \"modular\" proposals included Rodney Brook's subsumption architecture , object-oriented programming and others. ^ This is how the most widely used textbooks of the 21st century define artificial intelligence, such as Russell and Norvig, 2021; Padgham and Winikoff, 2004; Jones, 2007; Poole and Mackworth, 2017. [ 241 ] ^ Ray Kurzweil wrote\nthat the improvement in computer chess \"is governed only by the brute force expansion of computer hardware.\" [ 245 ] ^ Cycle time of Ferranti Mark 1 was 1.2 milliseconds, [ 246 ] which is arguably equivalent to about 833 flops . Deep Blue ran at 11.38 gigaflops [ 247 ] (and this does not even take into account Deep Blue's special-purpose hardware for chess). Very approximately, these differ by a factor of 10 7 . ^ AlexNet had 650,000 neurons and trained using ImageNet , augmented with reversed, cropped and tinted images. The model also used Geoffrey Hinton 's dropout technique and a rectified linear output function, both relatively new developments at the time. [ 258 ] ^ Several other laboratories had developed systems that, like AlexNet, used GPU chips and performed nearly as well as AlexNet, [ 112 ] but AlexNet proved to be the most influential. ^ See History of AI § The problems above, where Hans Moravec predicted that raw power would eventually make AI \"easy\". ^ Later research showed that there was no way for system to avoid a measurable racist bias – fixing one form of bias would necessarily introduce another.

[ 1 ] It has headquarters in Vancouver, Canada , [ 2 ] and offices in California, United States . Its platform matches employees' skill gaps against job and future job requirements, identifies career pathways, and recommends training. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] This connects workers to new opportunities within and outside their current organizations. [ 6 ] In November 2020, the company raised $8 million in a Series A funding round led by AllegisCyber Capital with participation from Accenture , Workday Ventures, and the Partnership Fund for New York City . [ 7 ] The following year, in October 2021, SkyHive raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by Eldridge with participation from other investors such as Allegis Cyber, Accenture Ventures, Workday Ventures, and the Partnership Fund for New York City . [ 8 ] Awards and accolades [ edit ] In 2018, SkyHive was selected for the Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS) Program created by the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) to help increase the recruitment and retention of women to reach 25% representation by 2026. [ 9 ] SkyHive was awarded a B Corporation certification in June 2019. [ 10 ] In September 2020, CIX Canadian Innovation Exchange [ 11 ] announced SkyHive as one of the CIX Top 20 Early and CIX Top 10 Growth innovative Canadian technology startups. [ 12 ] In November 2020, SkyHive won the Technology Impact Award under the \"Spirit of BC Tech – Purpose\" category.

In June 2021, SkyHive was named as a Technology Pioneer by the World Economic Forum . [ 16 ] Partnerships [ edit ] In March 2020, Accenture formed a strategic partnership with SkyHive for Project Spotlight. As part of the project, startups that address areas of large-scale strategic importance are selected to help fill innovation gaps for the Global 2000s . These areas include closing employee skills gaps, data sovereignty, the future of work, edge systems at scale, and predictive systems. At the World Economic Forum ’s Jobs Reset Summit in October 2020, Leena Nair , Unilever 's Chief Human Resources Officer, announced a “first of its kind” collaborative partnership with Walmart , Accenture, and SkyHive to create “reskilling and redeployment pathways” for roles in the consumer goods industry. [ 4 ] [ 17 ] In April 2021, Accenture published a report [ 18 ] on the findings and results of the project. Unilever published an article [ 19 ] detailing the results of the project, with Unilever's VP Future of Work, Patrick Hull noting, \"What the pilot has taught us is that AI and data analytics give us solid grounds for having an optimistic view about the future of work and the opportunities for reskilling\". World Education Services and SkyHive implemented a project to test the feasibility of converting academic credential information into skills-based data. This project highlighted the mismatch between labor market supply and demand and the need to address inefficiencies in the labor market. [ 20 ] TECHNATION partnered with SkyHive to develop Career Finder, a \"one-of-a-kind, real-time data hub that provides all of the labor market insights available to today’s growing cybersecurity industry\" under the guidance of the Tri-sector Cybersecurity Talent Alliance.

The process of automated art-making has existed since antiquity. The field of artificial intelligence was founded in the 1950s, and artists began to create art with artificial intelligence shortly after the discipline's founding. A select number of these creations have been showcased in museums and have been recognized with awards. [ 1 ] Throughout its history , AI has raised many philosophical questions related to the human mind , artificial beings , and the nature of art in human–AI collaboration. During the AI boom of the 2020s, text-to-image models such as Midjourney , DALL-E and Stable Diffusion became widely available to the public, allowing users to quickly generate imagery with little effort. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Commentary about AI art in the 2020s has often focused on issues related to copyright , deception , defamation , and its impact on more traditional artists, including technological unemployment . History [ edit ] See also: History of artificial intelligence and Timeline of artificial intelligence Early history [ edit ] Maillardet's automaton drawing a picture Automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization , when inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as designing machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Creative automatons have flourished throughout history, such as Maillardet's automaton , created around 1800 and capable of creating multiple drawings and poems. [ 6 ] Also in the 19th century, Ada Lovelace , wrote that \"computing operations\" could potentially be used to generate music and poems. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] In 1950, Alan Turing 's paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \" focused on whether machines can mimic human behavior convincingly. [ 9 ] Shortly after, the academic discipline of artificial intelligence was founded at a research workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. [ 10 ] Since its founding, AI researchers have explored philosophical questions about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth , fiction , and philosophy since antiquity. [ 11 ] Artistic history [ edit ] Karl Sims ' Galápagos installation allowed visitors to evolve 3D animated forms. Since the founding of AI in the 1950s, artists have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. These works were sometimes referred to as algorithmic art , [ 12 ] computer art , digital art , or new media art . [ 13 ] One of the first significant AI art systems is AARON , developed by Harold Cohen beginning in the late 1960s at the University of California at San Diego. [ 14 ] AARON uses a symbolic rule-based approach to generate technical images in the era of GOFAI programming, and it was developed by Cohen with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing. [ 15 ] AARON was exhibited in 1972 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . [ 16 ] From 1973 to 1975, Cohen refined AARON during a residency at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University . [ 17 ] In 2024, the Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited AI art from throughout Cohen's career, including re-created versions of his early robotic drawing machines. [ 17 ] Karl Sims has exhibited art created with artificial life since the 1980s. He received an M.S. in computer graphics from the MIT Media Lab in 1987 and was artist-in-residence from 1990 to 1996 at the supercomputer manufacturer and artificial intelligence company Thinking Machines . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] In both 1991 and 1992, Sims won the Golden Nica award at Prix Ars Electronica for his videos using artificial evolution. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] In 1997, Sims created the interactive artificial evolution  installation Galápagos for the NTT InterCommunication Center in Tokyo. [ 24 ] Sims received an Emmy Award in 2019 for outstanding achievement in engineering development. [ 25 ] Example of Electric Sheep by Scott Draves In 1999, Scott Draves and a team of several engineers created and released Electric Sheep as a free software screensaver. [ 26 ] Electric Sheep is a volunteer computing project for animating and evolving fractal flames , which are distributed to networked computers that display them as a screensaver. The screensaver used AI to create an infinite animation by learning from its audience. In 2001, Draves won the Fundacion Telefónica Life 4.0 prize for Electric Sheep . [ 27 ] [ unreliable source? ] In 2014, Stephanie Dinkins began working on Conversations with Bina48 . [ 28 ] For the series, Dinkins recorded her conversations with BINA48 , a social robot that resembles a middle-aged black woman. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] In 2019, Dinkins won the Creative Capital award for her creation of an evolving artificial intelligence based on the \"interests and culture(s) of people of color.\" [ 31 ] In 2015, Sougwen Chung began Mimicry (Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 1) , an ongoing collaboration between the artist and a robotic arm. [ 32 ] In 2019, Chung won the Lumen Prize for her continued performances with a robotic arm that uses AI to attempt to draw in a manner similar to Chung. [ 33 ] Edmond de Belamy , created with a generative adversarial network in 2018 In 2018, an auction sale of artificial intelligence art was held at Christie's in New York where the AI artwork Edmond de Belamy sold for US$ 432,500, which was almost 45 times higher than its estimate of US$7,000–10,000. The artwork was created by Obvious, a Paris-based collective. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] In 2024, Japanese film generAIdoscope was released. The film was co-directed by Hirotaka Adachi , Takeshi Sone, and Hiroki Yamaguchi. All video, audio, and music in the film were created with artificial intelligence. [ 37 ] In 2025, the Japanese anime television series Twins Hinahima was released. The anime was produced and animated with AI assistance during the process of cutting and conversion of photographs into anime illustrations and later retouched by art staff. Most of the remaining parts such as characters and logos were hand-drawn with various software. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Technical history [ edit ] Deep learning , characterized by its multi-layer structure that attempts to mimic the human brain, first came about in the 2010s, causing a significant shift in the world of AI art. [ 40 ] During the deep learning era, there are mainly these types of designs for generative art: autoregressive models , diffusion models , GANs , normalizing flows . In 2014, Ian Goodfellow and colleagues at Université de Montréal developed the generative adversarial network (GAN), a type of deep neural network capable of learning to mimic the statistical distribution of input data such as images. The GAN uses a \"generator\" to create new images and a \"discriminator\" to decide which created images are considered successful. [ 41 ] Unlike previous algorithmic art that followed hand-coded rules, generative adversarial networks could learn a specific aesthetic by analyzing a dataset of example images. [ 12 ] In 2015, a team at Google released DeepDream , a program that uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] The process creates deliberately over-processed images with a dream-like appearance reminiscent of a psychedelic experience . [ 45 ] Later, in 2017, a conditional GAN learned to generate 1000 image classes of ImageNet , a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] By conditioning the GAN on both random noise and a specific class label, this approach enhanced the quality of image synthesis for class-conditional models. [ 48 ] Autoregressive models were used for image generation, such as PixelRNN (2016), which autoregressively generates one pixel after another with a recurrent neural network . [ 49 ] Immediately after the Transformer architecture was proposed in Attention Is All You Need (2018), it was used for autoregressive generation of images, but without text conditioning. [ 50 ] The website Artbreeder , launched in 2018, uses the models StyleGAN and BigGAN [ 51 ] [ 52 ] to allow users to generate and modify images such as faces, landscapes, and paintings. [ 53 ] In the 2020s, text-to-image models , which generate images based on prompts , became widely used, marking yet another shift in the creation of AI-generated artworks. [ 2 ] Example of an image made with VQGAN-CLIP (NightCafe Studio, March 2023) Example of an image made with Flux 1.1 Pro in Raw mode (November 2024); this mode is designed to generate photorealistic images In 2021, using the influential large language generative pre-trained transformer models that are used in GPT-2 and GPT-3 , OpenAI released a series of images created with the text-to-image AI model DALL-E 1 . [ 54 ] It is an autoregressive generative model with essentially the same architecture as GPT-3. Along with this, later in 2021, EleutherAI released the open source VQGAN-CLIP [ 55 ] based on OpenAI's CLIP model. [ 56 ] Diffusion models , generative models used to create synthetic data based on existing data, [ 57 ] were first proposed in 2015, [ 58 ] but they only became better than GANs in early 2021. [ 59 ] Latent diffusion model was published in December 2021 and became the basis for the later Stable Diffusion (August 2022), developed through a collaboration between Stability AI, CompVis Group at LMU Munich, and Runway. [ 60 ] In 2022, Midjourney [ 61 ] was released, followed by Google Brain 's Imagen and Parti, which were announced in May 2022, Microsoft 's NUWA-Infinity, [ 62 ] [ 2 ] and the source-available Stable Diffusion , which was released in August 2022. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] DALL-E 2, a successor to DALL-E, was beta-tested and released (with the further successor DALL-E 3 being released in 2023). Stability AI has a Stable Diffusion web interface called DreamStudio, [ 66 ] plugins for Krita , Photoshop , Blender , and GIMP , [ 67 ] and the Automatic1111 web-based open source user interface . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Stable Diffusion's main pre-trained model is shared on the Hugging Face Hub . [ 71 ] Ideogram was released in August 2023, this model is known for its ability to generate legible text. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] In 2024, Flux was released. This model can generate realistic images and was integrated into Grok , the chatbot used on X (formerly Twitter) , and Le Chat , the chatbot of Mistral AI . [ 3 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Flux was developed by Black Forest Labs, founded by the researchers behind Stable Diffusion. [ 77 ] Grok later switched to its own text-to-image model Aurora in December of the same year. [ 78 ] Several companies, along with their products, have also developed an AI model integrated with an image editing service. Adobe has released and integrated the AI model Firefly into Premiere Pro , Photoshop , and Illustrator . [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Microsoft has also publicly announced AI image-generator features for Microsoft Paint . [ 81 ] Along with this, some examples of text-to-video models of the mid-2020s are Runway 's Gen-4, Google's VideoPoet , OpenAI's Sora , which was released in December 2024, and LTX-2 which was released in 2025. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] In 2025, several models were released. GPT Image 1 from OpenAI , launched in March 2025, introduced new text rendering and multimodal capabilities, enabling image generation from diverse inputs like sketches and text. [ 85 ] MidJourney v7 debuted in April 2025, providing improved text prompt processing. [ 86 ] In May 2025, Flux.1 Kontext by Black Forest Labs emerged as an efficient model for high-fidelity image generation, [ 87 ] while Google's Imagen 4 was released with improved photorealism. [ 88 ] Flux.2 debuted in November 2025 with improved image reference, typography, and prompt understanding. [ 89 ] Tools and processes [ edit ] Approaches [ edit ] There are many approaches used by artists to develop AI visual art. When text-to-image is used, AI generates images based on textual descriptions, using models like diffusion or transformer-based architectures. Users input prompts and the AI produces corresponding visuals. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] When image-to-image is used, AI transforms an input image into a new style or form based on a prompt or style reference, such as turning a sketch into a photorealistic image or applying an artistic style. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] When image-to-video is used, AI generates short video clips or animations from a single image or a sequence of images, often adding motion or transitions. This can include animating still portraits or creating dynamic scenes. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] When text-to-video is used, AI creates videos directly from text prompts, producing animations, realistic scenes, or abstract visuals. This is an extension of text-to-image but focuses on temporal sequences. [ 96 ] Imagery [ edit ] Example of a usage of ComfyUI for Stable Diffusion XL. People can adjust variables (such as CFG, seed, and sampler) needed to generate image. There are many tools available to the artist when working with diffusion models. They can define both positive and negative prompts, but they are also afforded a choice in using (or omitting the use of) VAEs , LoRAs , hypernetworks, IP-adapter, and embedding/textual inversions. Artists can tweak settings like guidance scale (which balances creativity and accuracy), seed (to control randomness), and upscalers (to enhance image resolution), among others. Additional influence can be exerted during pre-inference by means of noise manipulation, while traditional post-processing techniques are frequently used post-inference. People can also train their own models. In addition, procedural \"rule-based\" image generation techniques have been developed, utilizing mathematical patterns, algorithms that simulate brush strokes and other painterly effects, as well as deep learning models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and transformers. Several companies have released applications and websites that allow users to focus exclusively on positive prompts, bypassing the need for manual configuration of other parameters. There are also programs capable of transforming photographs into stylized images that mimic the aesthetics of well-known painting styles. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] There are many options, ranging from simple consumer-facing mobile apps to Jupyter notebooks and web UIs that require powerful GPUs to run effectively. [ 99 ] Additional functionalities include \"textual inversion,\" which refers to enabling the use of user-provided concepts (like an object or a style) learned from a few images. Novel art can then be generated from the associated word(s) (the text that has been assigned to the learned, often abstract, concept) [ 100 ] [ 101 ] and model extensions or fine-tuning (such as DreamBooth ). Impact and applications [ edit ] AI has the potential for a societal transformation , which may include enabling the expansion of non-commercial niche genres (such as cyberpunk derivatives like solarpunk ) by amateurs, novel entertainment, fast prototyping, [ 102 ] increasing art-making accessibility, [ 102 ] and artistic output per effort or expenses or time [ 102 ] —e.g., via generating drafts, draft-definitions, and image components ( inpainting ). Generated images are sometimes used as sketches, [ 103 ] low-cost experiments, [ 104 ] inspiration, or illustrations of proof-of-concept -stage ideas. Additional functionalities or improvements may also relate to post-generation manual editing (i.e., polishing), such as subsequent tweaking with an image editor. [ 104 ] Professional visual artists and designers used generative AI in early-stage conceptualisation (divergent thinking) more than final production (convergent thinking) and practices producing digital or ephemeral outputs (e.g., UI/UX design, concept art) more readily integrate these than those producing physical, permanent artefacts (e.g., sculpture, architecture). [ 105 ] In physical domains, concerns regarding structural integrity, material constraints, and cultural \"ethno-computation\" often limit AI to a \"complementary enhancement\" role rather than a substitute for production. [ 106 ] Furthermore, attitudes toward adoption vary significantly by career stage, with entry-level professionals viewing generative AI as a pragmatic extension of digital tools necessary for market competitiveness, whereas senior practitioners often express critical scepticism regarding the devaluation of embodied expertise and long-term skill development. [ 105 ] Prompt engineering and sharing [ edit ] See also: Prompt engineering § Text-to-image Prompts for some text-to-image models can also include images and keywords and configurable parameters, such as artistic style, which is often used via keyphrases like \"in the style of [name of an artist]\" in the prompt [ 107 ] /or selection of a broad aesthetic/art style. [ 108 ] [ 103 ] There are platforms for sharing, trading, searching, forking/refining, or collaborating on prompts for generating specific imagery from image generators. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] Prompts are often shared along with images on image-sharing websites such as Reddit and AI art-dedicated websites. A prompt is not the complete input needed for the generation of an image; additional inputs that determine the generated image include the output resolution , random seed , and random sampling parameters. [ 113 ] Related terminology [ edit ] Synthetic media , which includes AI art, was described in 2022 as a major technology-driven trend that will affect business in the coming years. [ 102 ] Harvard Kennedy School researchers voiced concerns about synthetic media serving as a vector for political misinformation soon after studying the proliferation of AI art on the X platform. [ 114 ] Synthography is a proposed term for the practice of generating images that are similar to photographs using AI. [ 115 ] Analysis of existing art using AI [ edit ] In addition to the creation of original art, research methods that use AI have been generated to quantitatively analyze digital art collections. This has been made possible due to the large-scale digitization of artwork in the past few decades. According to CETINIC and SHE (2022), using artificial intelligence to analyze already-existing art collections can provide new perspectives on the development of artistic styles and the identification of artistic influences. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] Two computational methods, close reading and distant viewing, are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art. [ 118 ] Close reading focuses on specific visual aspects of one piece. Some tasks performed by machines in close reading methods include computational artist authentication and analysis of brushstrokes or texture properties. In contrast, through distant viewing methods, the similarity across an entire collection for a specific feature can be statistically visualized. Common tasks relating to this method include automatic classification, object detection , multimodal tasks , knowledge discovery in art history, and computational aesthetics. [ 117 ] Synthetic images can also be used to train AI algorithms for art authentication and to detect forgeries. [ 119 ] Researchers have also introduced models that predict emotional responses to art. One such model is ArtEmis, a large-scale dataset paired with machine learning models. ArtEmis includes emotional annotations from over 6,500 participants along with textual explanations. By analyzing both visual inputs and the accompanying text descriptions from this dataset, ArtEmis enables the generation of nuanced emotional predictions. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Other forms of AI art [ edit ] AI has also been used in arts outside of visual arts. Generative AI has been used to create music , as well as in video game production beyond imagery , especially for level design (e.g., for custom maps ) and creating new content (e.g., quests or dialogue) or interactive stories in video games. [ 122 ] [ 123 ] AI has also been used in the literary arts , [ 124 ] such as helping with writer's block , inspiration, or rewriting segments. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] [ 127 ] [ 128 ] In the culinary arts, some prototype cooking robots can dynamically taste , which can assist chefs in analyzing the content and flavor of dishes during the cooking process. [ 129 ] Use of the term \"art\" [ edit ] The usage of the label \"art\" when it applies to works generated by AI software has led to debate among artists, philosophers, scholars, and more. Various observers argue that referring to machine generated images as \"art\" undermines the traditional characteristics of human artistry, such as creativity, skill, and intentionality. Present-day definitions of true artistic creation often put an emphasis on the requirement of human-level intentions, personal experience and emotion, as well as historical and/or artistic context. [ 130 ] According to a research study from the National Library of Medicine, humans inherently show a bias against artwork described as being AI-generated. When participants of the study were shown two comparable images, with only one presented as having been generated by AI, subjects were more likely to rate the one described as being artificially generated lower in artistic value. This suggests that social and cultural attitudes can shape the determination of whether an image is considered art, regardless of the image's other visual features. [ 131 ] In a 2023 report submitted to the Annual Convention of Digital Art Observers , Samuel Loomis wrote that the term \"AI art\" acknowledges its dual nature as a product of human guidance and machine-driven generative systems, when evaluating it by the same critical standards applied to traditional art.

The AI boom has led to concerns including the existential risk from artificial intelligence , as the uptake on applications of artificial intelligence increases. By late 2025, global finance and artificial intelligence were \"deeply intertwined\". [ 1 ] A June 2025 Menlo Ventures report raised concerns about the sustainability of future revenue and long-term profitability of AI, given the relatively low rate of consumer monetization. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] 2017 [ edit ] 30 November —The New York Times said that new AI reports by McKinsey & Company , the National Bureau of Economic Research , and an AI Index created by university researchers, indicated an early AI boom. [ 4 ] The Index built on a project—\"The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence\" launched in 2014. [ 5 ] 2018 [ edit ] —2018 was a year of incremental AI growth in finance. [ 6 ] 2022 [ edit ] —The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI became the catalyst for an artificial intelligence boom that continues to remake the global economy. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] — According to a European Central Bank report, public interest in AI increased rapidly as evidenced with rising Google searches, AI jobs, models, patents, and innovations since late 2022. At that time Europe led the US in the size of its AI workforce. [ 9 ] 2023 [ edit ] The regulatory body, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), published their report, \"Generative Artificial Intelligence in Finance: Risk Considerations\", drawing attention to oversight gaps and the need for regulations. [ 10 ] The report explores the risks posed by using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems in the financial sector including \"broader risks to financial stability.\" [ 10 ] : 5 2024 [ edit ] January 12 —In January 2024 Bloomberg 's published its list of the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech companies on the stock market based on their strength, size and market capitalization— Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet (Google), Amazon , Meta Platforms (Facebook), Nvidia , and Tesla . [ 11 ] 21 June —During the AI boom, Nvidia became the world's most valuable company, surpassing Microsoft , as its value increased to over US$4 trillion. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] — In 2023 and 2024, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks were the primary drivers behind the increase in equity indexes, according to Reuters . [ 14 ] 2025 [ edit ] January [ edit ] 23 January —President Donald Trump's AI policy was announced calling for United States global leadership in artificial intelligence. [ 15 ] The Economist noted that this politic shift in which the United States seeks \"global dominance\" in AI includes trimming regulations and assisting in expansion of infrastructure and increase in number of AI workers. Governments of Gulf nations were also investing trillions of dollars in AI. [ 16 ] 27 January —Against the backdrop of a tech war between China and the United States over AI dominance, within days of the launch of China's free DeepSeek App, it was the most downloaded app in the United States, [ 17 ] rising to the first place in the Apple app store. [ 18 ] President Trump responded immediately, saying this \"sudden rise\" should be a \"wake-up\" call to the United States, and called on US companies to be more competitive. [ 18 ] June [ edit ] 26 June —In their June 2025 report, Menlo Ventures estimated that only about 3% of consumers paid for artificial intelligence-related services, representing about $USD12 billion in annual spending. This is relatively low in contrast to the massive capital expenditure by AI infrastructure companies, which raises concerns about revenue sustainability and long-term profitability. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] July [ edit ] 23 July —The Trump administration launched the US AI Action Plan, positioning the United States in a high-stakes technological race with China for global dominance in artificial intelligence, emphasizing that neither nation can afford to fall behind due to the exponential nature of AI advancement. [ 19 ] The plan, a new government website and policy speech called for accelerated AI adoption across federal agencies, and a number of initiatives to make is easier for AI infrastructure expansion, and other measures to ensure American leadership in AI standards. Some leading experts warned that the administration failed to provide sufficient regulations and safeguards for AI safety. Concerns were raised about the negative impacts of cuts to research funding and tightened visa policies for scientists, potentially undermining public trust and America's ability to compete internationally. [ 20 ] September [ edit ] 7 September — The Economist cautioned that AI revenues are relatively modest compared to the high cost and investments in the creation of new data centers. [ 16 ] Even Sam Altman — OpenAI CEO and one of the leading figures of the AI boom , [ 21 ] —raised concerns about investors' outsized hopes for financial returns. At the same time, history has shown that new technologies, like railways and electricity, endured and spread after the initial hype faded. [ 16 ] 12 September —Economists warn that U.S. households' direct and indirect investments—mutual funds or retirement plans—in the stock market reached an unprecedented historically high level, now representing 45% of all financial assets, or about $USD51.2 trillion. [ 22 ] Compared to the Dot-com bubble this represents a sharp increase in exposure. This makes U.S. households vulnerable to market downturns which in turn would result in decreasing consumer spending. [ 22 ] U.S. household net worth rose to a record $176.3 trillion in the second quarter, an increase of $7.3 trillion since early 2025 and about $46 trillion higher than before the pandemic. Federal Reserve data attribute the surge primarily to gains in stock markets and housing values. However, the rise in wealth on paper coincided with increased household borrowing and growing government debt. [ 23 ] 18 September —Questions were being raised about how quickly the data centers, chips, servers, and GPUs assets of major AI companies will depreciate in value. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Comparisons have been made to the Railway Mania in the aftermath of the stock market bubble where a valuable physical infrastructure remained standing, and the telecoms crash after the dot-com bubble which left fiber networks. [ 25 ] 28 September —There were warnings that record-high American stock ownership during the AI-fueled market boom is a red flag for systemic risk, as the current concentration in equities exceeds levels seen before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, and could amplify the impact of any future stock market correction. [ 22 ] October [ edit ] 3 October —In 2025 alone, venture capitalists invested almost $USD200 billion in the artificial intelligence sector. [ 26 ] 29 October —Nvidia was the first company in the world to be valued at US$5 trillion, [ 27 ] largely due to AI demand and strategic partnerships with leading technology and AI firms. [ 28 ] Nvidia's increase in value was \"meteoric\". [ 7 ] November [ edit ] 2 November — Forbes reported that, since April, the 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants together contributed over 40% of the S&P 500 's return, highlighting their outsized influence and the growing impact of AI on market valuations. [ 29 ] CNN warned that while there is a current benefit to investors, with such a high concentration in the S&P 500, they are highly exposed to the fate of the Mag Seven. [ 22 ] 2 November —Globally there are 11,000 datacentres—huge campuses for AI infrastructure, including thousands of chips, GPUS, and servers. [ 30 ] This represents a 500% increase over the last two decades. [ 31 ] It is anticipated that $3USDtn more will be spent on increasing that number over the next two or three years. [ 31 ] 5 November —Concerns about the potential for a market bubble were raised as six of the AI-related Big Tech \"Magnificent Seven\"—that contribute to the AI boom —reported losing ground in the stock market. [ 1 ] Global markets and artificial intelligence have become \"deeply intertwined\", according to a Reuters report. [ 1 ] —As of November 2025, more than 50% of the 20 largest S&P firms were deeply exposed to AI. In contrast, in 2000, the 20 S&P 500 firms represented 39% of its total value only 11 of these companies were exposed to the internet. If AI fails to deliver strong returns on their investments, these top S&P firms would be significantly impacted, according to the Economist . [ 32 ] —Analysts suggest that the AI market in 2025 may not behave like a traditional one, as investors are simultaneously aware of the risks and driven by the potential for outsized rewards. Leading AI labs may believe that the first company to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI)—when an AI system surpasses all human cognitive abilities and becomes capable of self-improvement—could dominate the future of technology and finance. While some have estimated that the potential value of such a breakthrough could be as high as $1.46 quadrillion, this figure is speculative and widely debated. [ 25 ] 4 Nvidia H100 GPUs 5 November —Bloomberg described Nvidia's H100 Hopper-Blackwell AI chips as the \"King of AI chips\". [ 33 ] Nvidia dominates the AI chip market with over 78% of the market share because of both speed and cost. According to Business Insider , the technical superiority and widespread developer familiarity with Nvidia's platform resulted in H100 chips becoming the preferred choice for demanding AI workloads. [ 34 ] 7 November — Andrew Bailey , Governor of the Bank of England called attention to the risk to the market in light of the lack of certainty about future earnings in AI versus AI companies \"very positive productivity contribution\". [ 35 ] 10 November —The first report of the Forecasting Research institute's (FRI) Longitudinal Expert AI Panel (LEAP) was published, providing insights into the projected high-stakes impact of AI by 2030. The panel includes hundreds of leading experts from computer science, economics, and AI policy —including superforecasters . LEAP experts forecast that around 18% of work hours in the US will be assisted by generative AI by 2030, up sharply from approximately 2% in 2025. This reflects a major anticipated integration of AI technologies into daily work and productivity. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] 11 November —By late fall 2025, these large AI-related tech companies—including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google—had begun using loans and financial instruments— special purpose vehicles (S.P.V.), asset-backed securities (A.B.S.)—to obtain the capital they need for large investments in their new data centers and AI infrastructure. [ 3 ] Elon Musk 's xAI and Meta used S.P.V.s, rather than relying only on their own cash flow, to acquire tens of billions in debt for major investments. [ 3 ] Citing the June Menlo report on low consumer interest in paid AI use combined with huge capital expenditure by large AI companies, a New York Times article cited growing concerns about revenue sustainability, long-term profitability, and the potential risk factor for credit markets, as tech firms take on increasing amounts of debt to finance acquisition of billions of dollars of Nvidia chips, for example. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] December [ edit ] 10 December —In October 2025, a workshop on “AI and financial stability” in the Financial Industry Forum on Artificial Intelligence II (FIFAI II), co‑hosted by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Department of Finance Canada, the Bank of Canada, and the Global Risk Institute, brought together over 50 Canadian and international experts from the financial sector, regulators, academia, and business. An interim report dated 23 November 2025 stated that 44% of participants viewed autonomous or so-called agentic AI systems as the most likely current source of AI‑related systemic risk in finance.

Created by a pseudonymous artificial intelligence researcher known as 15 , who began developing the technology as a freshman during their undergraduate research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the application allows users to make characters from video games, television shows, and movies speak custom text with emotional inflections. The platform is able to generate convincing voice output using minimal training data; the name \"15.ai\" references the creator's statement that a voice can be cloned with just 15 seconds of audio. It was an early example of an application of generative artificial intelligence during the initial stages of the AI boom . Launched in March 2020, 15.ai became an Internet phenomenon in early 2021 when content utilizing it went viral on social media and quickly gained widespread use among Internet fandoms , such as the My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic , Team Fortress 2 , and SpongeBob SquarePants fandoms. The service featured emotional context through emojis , precise pronunciation control, and multi-speaker capabilities. Critics praised 15.ai's accessibility and emotional control but criticized its technical limitations in prosody options and non-English language support, with mixed results depending on character complexity. 15.ai is credited as the first platform to popularize AI voice cloning in memes and content creation . [ a ] Voice actors and industry professionals debated 15.ai's implications, raising concerns about employment impacts , voice-related fraud , and potential misuse . In January 2022, it was discovered that a company called Voiceverse had generated voice lines using 15.ai without attribution , promoted them as the byproduct of their own technology, and sold them as non-fungible tokens (NFT) without permission. News publications universally characterized this incident as the company having \"stolen\" from 15.ai. [ b ] The service went offline in September 2022 due to legal issues surrounding artificial intelligence and copyright . Its shutdown was followed by the emergence of commercial alternatives whose founders have acknowledged 15.ai's pioneering influence in the field of deep learning speech synthesis . On May 18, 2025, 15 launched 15.dev as the sequel to 15.ai. History [ edit ] [...] The website has multiple purposes. It serves as a proof of concept of a platform that allows anyone to create content, even if they can't hire someone to voice their projects. It also demonstrates the progress of my research in a far more engaging manner – by being able to use the actual model, you can discover things about it that even I wasn't aware of (such as getting characters to make gasping noises or moans by placing commas in between certain phonemes). It also doesn't let me get away with picking and choosing the best results and showing off only the ones that work [...] Being able to interact with the model with no filter allows the user to judge exactly how good the current work is at face value. 15, Hacker News [ 37 ] Background [ edit ] For broader coverage of this topic, see Deep learning speech synthesis § History . See also: History of speech synthesis The field of speech synthesis underwent a significant transformation with the introduction of deep learning approaches. In 2016, DeepMind 's publication of the WaveNet paper marked a shift toward neural network -based speech synthesis, which enabled higher audio quality via causal convolutional neural networks . Previously, concatenative synthesis —which worked by stitching together pre-recorded segments of human speech—was the predominant method for generating artificial speech, but it often produced robotic-sounding results at the boundaries of sentences. [ 38 ] In 2018, Google AI 's Tacotron 2 showed that neural networks could produce highly natural speech synthesis but required substantial training data (typically tens of hours of audio) to achieve acceptable quality. When trained on two hours of training data, the output quality degraded while still being able to maintain intelligible speech; with 24 minutes of training data, Tacotron 2 failed to produce intelligible speech. [ 39 ] The same year saw the emergence of HiFi-GAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based vocoder that improved the efficiency of waveform generation while producing high-fidelity speech, [ 40 ] followed by Glow-TTS, which introduced a flow-based approach that allowed for both fast inference and voice style transfer capabilities. [ 41 ] Chinese tech companies like Baidu and ByteDance also made contributions to the field by developing breakthroughs that further advanced the technology. [ 42 ] 2016–2020: Conception and development [ edit ] Derpy Hooves reciting the FitnessGram PACER test introduction in a neutral emotion [ 43 ] Variation #1 Duration: 14 seconds. 0:14 Variation #2 Duration: 13 seconds. 0:13 Variation #3 Duration: 15 seconds. 0:15 Problems playing these files? See media help . 15.ai was conceived in 2016 as a research project in deep learning speech synthesis by a developer known as 15 (at the age of 18 [ 44 ] ) during their freshman year at MIT as part of its Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program . [ 45 ] 15 was inspired by DeepMind's WaveNet paper, with development continuing through their studies as Google AI released Tacotron 2 the following year. By 2019, they had demonstrated at MIT their ability to replicate WaveNet and Tacotron 2's results using 75% less training data than previously required. [ 42 ] The name \"15.ai\" is a reference to the developer's statement that a voice can be cloned with as little as 15 seconds of data. [ 46 ] 15 had originally planned to pursue a PhD based on their undergraduate research, but opted to work in the tech industry instead after their startup was accepted into the Y Combinator accelerator in 2019. After their departure in early 2020, 15 returned to their voice synthesis research and began implementing it as a web application . According to a post on X from 15, instead of using conventional voice datasets like LJSpeech that contained simple, monotone recordings, they sought out more challenging voice samples that could demonstrate the model's ability to handle complex speech patterns and emotional undertones. [ tweet 1 ] During this phase, 15 discovered the Pony Preservation Project, a collaborative project started by /mlp/ , the My Little Pony board on 4chan . [ 47 ] Contributors of the project had manually trimmed, denoised, transcribed, and emotion-tagged thousands of voice lines from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic and had compiled them into a dataset that provided ideal training material for 15.ai. [ 48 ] 2020–2022: Release and operation [ edit ] 15.ai was released on March 2, 2020 [ 49 ] as a free and non-commercial web application that did not require user registration to use, but did require the user to accept its terms of service before proceeding. [ 12 ] At the time of its launch, the platform had a limited selection of available characters, including those from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic and Team Fortress 2 . [ 50 ] Users were permitted to create any content with the synthesized voices under two conditions: they had to properly credit 15.ai by including \"15.ai\" in any posts, videos, or projects using the generated audio; [ 51 ] and they were prohibited from mixing 15.ai outputs with other text-to-speech outputs in the same work to prevent misrepresentation of the technology's capabilities. [ 49 ] On March 8, 2020, Tyler McVicker of Valve News Network uploaded a YouTube video showcasing 15.ai. [ video 1 ] More voices were added to the website in the following months. In late 2020, 15 implemented a multi-speaker embedding in the deep neural network, which enabled the simultaneous training of multiple voices. [ 42 ] Following this, the website's roster expanded from eight to over fifty characters. [ 44 ] In addition, this implementation allowed the deep learning model to recognize common emotional patterns across different characters, even when certain emotions were missing from the characters' training data. [ 52 ] By May 2020, the site had served over 4.2 million audio files to users. [ 53 ] In early 2021, the application gained popularity after skits, memes, and fan content created using 15.ai went viral on Twitter , TikTok , Reddit , Twitch , Facebook , and YouTube . [ 54 ] At its peak, the platform incurred operational costs of US$ 12,000 [ 55 ] per month from AWS infrastructure needed to handle millions of daily voice generations; despite receiving offers from companies to acquire 15.ai and its underlying technology, the website remained independent and was funded out of the personal previous startup earnings of the developer. [ 42 ] 2022: Voiceverse NFT controversy [ edit ] Main article: Voiceverse NFT plagiarism scandal See also: Non-fungible token § Plagiarism and fraud , and Artificial intelligence controversies A satirical meme representing the \"right-click, save as\" criticism of NFTs . Critics of Voiceverse pointed out the irony of selling ownership rights to AI voices when they themselves had stolen 15.ai's technology. On January 14, 2022, 15 discovered that a blockchain -based company called Voiceverse had generated voice lines using 15.ai, falsely showcased them on Twitter as a demonstration of their own voice technology without permission or attribution, [ 56 ] and sold them as NFTs. [ 57 ] This came shortly after 15 had stated in December 2021 that they had no interest in incorporating NFTs into their work. [ 58 ] A screenshot of the log files posted by 15 showed that Voiceverse had generated audio of characters from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic using 15.ai and pitched them up to make them sound unrecognizable, [ 59 ] a violation of 15.ai's terms of service, which explicitly prohibited commercial use and required proper attribution. [ 60 ] When confronted with evidence, Voiceverse stated that their marketing team had used 15.ai without proper attribution while rushing to create a demo . [ 61 ] In response, 15 tweeted \"Go fuck yourself,\" [ 62 ] which went viral, amassing hundreds of thousands of retweets and likes on Twitter in support of the developer. [ 42 ] The tweets showcasing the stolen voices were subsequently deleted. [ 14 ] Avatar of Troy Baker Troy Baker ( @TroyBakerVA ) tweeted: I'm partnering with @VoiceverseNFT to explore ways where together we might bring new tools to new creators to make new things, and allow everyone a chance to own & invest in the IP's they create. We all have a story to tell.\nYou can hate.\nOr you can create. What'll it be? January 14, 2022 [ 63 ] Aftermath [ edit ] The controversy raised concerns about NFT projects, which, according to critics, were frequently associated with intellectual property theft and questionable business practices. [ 64 ] The incident was documented in the AI Incident Database (AIID) [ 23 ] and the AI, Algorithmic, and Automation Incidents and Controversies (AIAAIC) repository, [ 24 ] and was also featured in Molly White 's Web3 Is Going Just Great website. [ 17 ] Pavel Khibchenko of Skillbox listed the incident as an example of fraud in NFTs . [ 65 ] Voice actor and YouTuber Yong Yea criticized voice NFTs for their potential impact on the voice acting industry [ 25 ] and stated in a YouTube video that Voiceverse deliberately plagiarized 15.ai's superior technology to falsely market voice NFTs. [ video 2 ] : 15:54–16:13 In a 2024 class action lawsuit filed against LOVO, Inc., the parent company of Voiceverse, court documents cited the company's prior theft of 15.ai's technology as part of the case. [ 66 ] Voice actor Troy Baker , who had announced his partnership with Voiceverse alongside their promotion of the stolen AI voices, faced mounting criticism for supporting an NFT project and for his confrontational announcement tone. [ 67 ] Following continued backlash and the plagiarism revelation, Baker acknowledged that his original tweet was \"antagonistic\" [ 68 ] and on January 31, announced that he would discontinue his partnership with Voiceverse. [ 69 ] 2022–2024: Inactivity [ edit ] In September 2022, 15.ai was taken offline. [ 70 ] In a post on Twitter, 15 suggested a future version that would better address copyright concerns from the outset. [ 42 ] During this period of inactivity, voice AI startups continued to cite 15.ai as a major influence to the field. [ 71 ] Y Combinator startup PlayHT called the debut of 15.ai \"a breakthrough in the field of text-to-speech (TTS) and speech synthesis\". [ 72 ] Cliff Weitzman , the founder and CEO of Speechify , credited 15.ai for \"making AI voice cloning popular for content creation by being the first [...] to feature popular existing characters from fandoms\". [ 73 ] Mati Staniszewski , co-founder and CEO of ElevenLabs , wrote that 15.ai was transformative in the field of AI text-to-speech. [ 74 ] 2025–present: Revival [ edit ] On May 18, 2025, 15 launched 15.dev as the official sequel to 15.ai. [ 75 ] [ tweet 2 ] [ 76 ] Fandom news site Equestria Daily reported that the website included \"almost every voiced pony in the show\" with \"a dropdown for various emotions you want to generate.\" [ 77 ] Features [ edit ] Three AI-generated voice line variations from 15.ai showing their waveforms and respective alignment confidence scores 15.ai is non-commercial, has no advertisements, generates no revenue, and operates without requiring user registration or accounts. [ 78 ] Users are able to generate speech by inputting text and selecting a character voice, with optional parameters for emotional contextualizers and phonetic transcriptions. Each request produces three audio variations with distinct emotional deliveries. [ 79 ] Characters available included multiple characters from Team Fortress 2 and My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic , including the Mane Six and Derpy Hooves ; GLaDOS , Wheatley , and the Sentry Turret from the Portal series; SpongeBob SquarePants ; Kyu Sugardust from HuniePop , Rise Kujikawa from Persona 4 ; Daria Morgendorffer and Jane Lane from Daria ; Carl Brutananadilewski from Aqua Teen Hunger Force ; Steven Universe from Steven Universe ; Sans from Undertale ; Madeline and multiple characters from Celeste ; the Tenth Doctor from Doctor Who ; the Narrator from The Stanley Parable ; and HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey . [ 80 ] Silent characters like Chell and Gordon Freeman were able to be selected and would emit silent audio files when any text was submitted. [ 81 ] Characters from Undertale and Celeste did not produce spoken words but instead generated their games' distinctive beeps when text was entered. [ 82 ] Sample emoji probability distributions generated by the DeepMoji model. These emoji distributions were displayed on 15.ai as part of its technical metrics and graphs. [ 83 ] From 2020, 15.ai has generated audio at 44.1 kHz sampling rate —higher than the 16 kHz standard used by most deep learning text-to-speech systems of that period. This higher fidelity creates more detailed audio spectrograms and greater audio resolution with the tradeoff that imperfections in the synthesis are more noticeable. [ 84 ] 15.ai processes speech using customized deep neural networks and specialized audio synthesis algorithms. [ 85 ] While its underlying technology could produce 10 seconds of audio in less than 10 seconds of processing time (i.e. faster-than-real-time ), the user experience often involves longer waits as the servers manages thousands of simultaneous requests, sometimes taking more than a minute to deliver results. [ 86 ] Due to its nondeterministic design, 15.ai produces variations in its speech output. 15.ai introduced the concept of emotional contextualizers, which allowed users to specify the emotional tone of generated speech through guiding phrases. [ 87 ] The emotional contextualizer functionality utilized DeepMoji , a sentiment analysis neural network developed at the MIT Media Lab that processed emoji embeddings from 1.2 billion Twitter posts to analyze their emotional content. [ 51 ] If an input into 15.ai contained additional context (specified by a vertical bar), the additional context following the bar would be used as the emotional contextualizer. [ 88 ] For example, if the input was Today is a great day!|I'm very sad. , the selected character would speak the sentence \"Today is a great day!\" in the emotion one would expect from someone saying the sentence \"I'm very sad.\" [ 89 ] An example of a conversion of the text \" daisy bell \" into speech, starting from English orthography . English words are parsed as a string of ARPABET phonemes, then is passed through a pitch predictor and a mel-spectrogram generator to generate audio. 15.ai uses pronunciation data from Oxford Dictionaries API , Wiktionary , and CMU Pronouncing Dictionary , which uses ARPABET phonetic transcriptions. Users can input ARPABET transcriptions by enclosing phoneme strings in curly braces to correct mispronunciations. [ 51 ] 15.ai's interface uses color-coding to indicate pronunciation certainty [ 51 ] and also displays technical metrics, graphs, and comprehensive model analytics, which has included sentiment analysis and automatic improvements to the vocoder . [ 44 ] The platform limits its prompt to 200 characters; users can combine multiple generations for longer speech sequences. [ 90 ] Later versions of 15.ai introduced multi-speaker capabilities. Rather than training separate models for each voice, 15.ai uses a unified model that learned multiple voices simultaneously through speaker embeddings : numerical representations that capture each character's unique vocal characteristics. [ 42 ] Along with the emotional context conferred by DeepMoji, this allows the deep learning model to learn shared patterns across different characters' emotional expressions and speaking styles, even when characters lack examples of certain emotions in their training data. [ 91 ] Reception [ edit ] Critical reception [ edit ] Critics described 15.ai as easy to use and generally able to convincingly replicate character voices, with occasional mixed results. [ 92 ] Natalie Clayton of PC Gamer wrote that SpongeBob SquarePants ' voice was replicated well, but described challenges in mimicking the Narrator from the The Stanley Parable : \"the algorithm simply can't capture Kevan Brighting 's whimsically droll intonation.\" [ 93 ] Zack Zwiezen of Kotaku reported that \"[his] girlfriend was convinced it was a new voice line from GLaDOS' voice actor\". [ 94 ] Taiwanese newspaper United Daily News also highlighted 15.ai's ability to recreate GLaDOS's mechanical voice, alongside its diverse range of character voice options. [ 95 ] Yahoo! News Taiwan reported that \"GLaDOS in Portal can pronounce lines nearly perfectly\", but also criticized that \"there are still many imperfections, such as word limit and tone control, which are still a little weird in some words.\" [ 96 ] Chris Button of Byteside called the ability to clone a voice with only 15 seconds of data \"freaky,\" but also described the tech behind it as \"impressive.\" [ 97 ] Robin Lamorlette of Clubic described the technology as \"devilishly fun\" and wrote that Twitter and YouTube were filled with creative content from users experimenting with the tool. [ 98 ] The platform's voice generation capabilities were regularly featured on Equestria Daily with documented updates, fan creations, and additions of new character voices. In a post introducing new character additions to 15.ai, Equestria Daily' s founder Shaun Scotellaro wrote that \"some of [the voices] aren't great due to the lack of samples to draw from, but many are really impressive still anyway.\" [ 99 ] Chinese My Little Pony fan site EquestriaCN also documented 15.ai's development and its updates, though they criticized some of its bugs and long queue wait times. [ 100 ] Peter Paltridge of Anime Superhero News opined that \"voice synthesis has evolved to the point where the more expensive efforts are nearly indistinguishable from actual human speech,\" but also stated that \"In some ways, SAM is still more advanced than this. It was possible to affect SAM's inflections by using special characters, as well as change his pitch at will. With 15.ai, you're at the mercy of whatever random inflections you get.\" [ 101 ] Conversely, Lauren Morton of Rock, Paper, Shotgun praised the depth of pronunciation control—\"if you're willing to get into the nitty gritty of it\". [ 102 ] Similarly, Eugenio Moto of Qore.com wrote that \"the most experienced of users can change parameters like the stress or the tone.\" [ 103 ] Takayuki Furushima of Den Fami Nico Gamer highlighted the \"smooth pronunciations\", and Yuki Kurosawa of AUTOMATON wrote that its \"rich emotional expression\" was a major feature; both Japanese authors mentioned the lack of Japanese-language support. [ 104 ] Renan do Prado of Arkade and José Villalobos of LaPS4 remarked that while users could create amusing results in Portuguese and Spanish respectively, the generation performed best in English. [ 105 ] Chinese gaming news website GamerSky called the app \"interesting\", but also criticized the word count limit of the text and the occasional lack of intonations. [ 106 ] Marco Cocomello of GLITCHED remarked that despite the 200-character limitation, the results \"blew [him] away\" when testing the app with GLaDOS's voice. [ 107 ] Spanish author Álvaro Ibáñez wrote in Microsiervos that he found the rhythm of the AI-generated voices interesting and that 15.ai was able to adapt its delivery based on the text's meaning. [ 108 ] Technical reception [ edit ] AI researchers and practitioners provided more in-depth analysis of 15.ai's capabilities and limitations compared to other text-to-speech technologies of the time. Google DeepMind senior research scientist Alex Irpan wrote that when 15.ai launched in 2020, it was \"arguably the highest quality voice generation model in the world\" and superior to models developed by Google AI . [ 109 ] In their explanation for why they plagiarized from 15.ai , Voiceverse wrote that \"the best voice [their marketing team] could find was not [theirs] but 15.ai['s]\". [ 110 ] Rionaldi Chandraseta of Towards Data Science wrote that voice models trained on larger datasets created more convincing output with better phrasing and natural pauses, particularly for extended text. [ 85 ] Parth Mahendra of AI Daily wrote that while the system \"does a good job at accurately replicating most basic words,\" it struggled with more complex terms, noting that characters would \"absolutely butcher the pronunciation\" of certain words. [ 53 ] Dan Ruta, the creator of a downloadable voice AI tool called xVASynth, wrote that in comparison, cloud-based tools like 15.ai had the benefit of being accessible on any device. [ 111 ] Economist and AI commentator Tyler Cowen named 15.ai among examples of underrated talent in AI and machine learning . [ 112 ] Chinese AI researchers also offered various technical assessments. Machine learning professor Yongqiang Li wrote that 15.ai \"perfectly preserves the rhythm and characteristics of the speaker,\" and remarked that the application was still free despite having 5,000 people generating voices concurrently at the time of writing. [ 113 ] Bai Feng of XinZhiYuan on QQ News highlighted the technical achievement of 15.ai's high-quality output despite using minimal training data and wrote that it was of significantly higher quality than typical deep learning text-to-speech implementations. Feng also acknowledged that while some pronunciation errors occurred due to the limited training data, it was understandable given that contemporary deep learning models typically required 40 or more hours of audio. [ 114 ] Ji Yunyo of NetEase News called the technology behind 15.ai \"remarkably efficient\" but also criticized its emotional limitations, writing that the emotional expression was relatively \"neutral\" and that \"extreme\" emotions couldn't be properly synthesized, making it less suitable for not safe for work applications. [ 115 ] Ji also wrote that while many deepfake videos required creators to extract and edit material from hours of original content for very short results, 15.ai could achieve similar or better effects with only a few dozen minutes of training data per character. [ 116 ] Reactions from voice actors of featured characters [ edit ] Ellen McLain (voice of GLaDOS in Portal ) and John Patrick Lowrie (voice of the Sniper in Team Fortress 2 ) were interviewed on The VŌC Podcast in 2021 about their perspectives on 15.ai and AI voice synthesis technology. Some voice actors whose characters appeared on 15.ai have publicly shared their thoughts about the platform. In an April 2021 interview, John Patrick Lowrie —who voices the Sniper in Team Fortress 2 —said that he had discovered 15.ai when a prospective intern showed him a skit she had created using AI voices of the Team Fortress 2 characters. [ video 3 ] : 0:51:50 Lowrie commented: \"The technology still has a long way to go before you really believe that these are just human beings, but I was impressed by how much [15.ai] could do. [...] You certainly don't get the delivery that you get from an actual person who's analyzed the scene, [...] but I do think that as a fan source—for people wanting to put together mods and stuff like that—that it could be fun for fans to use the voices of characters they like.\" [ video 3 ] : 0:53:12 He drew an analogy to synthesized music , adding: \"If you want the sound of a choir , and you want the sound of an orchestra , and you have the money, you hire a choir and an orchestra. And if you don't have the money, you have something that sounds pretty nice; but it's not the same as a choir and an orchestra.\" [ video 3 ] : 1:01:10 In a 2021 live broadcast on his Twitch channel, Nathan Vetterlein —the voice actor of the Scout from Team Fortress 2 —listened to an AI recreation of his character's voice and commented: \"It's interesting; it's all right. There's some stuff in there\". [ video 4 ] Ethical concerns [ edit ] See also: Deepfake § Concerns and countermeasures Other voice actors had mixed reactions to 15.ai's capabilities. While some industry professionals acknowledged the technical innovation, others raised concerns about the technology's implications for their profession. [ 117 ] When voice actor Troy Baker announced his partnership with Voiceverse NFT, which had misappropriated 15.ai's technology, critics raised concerns about automated voice acting's potential reduction of employment opportunities for voice actors, risk of voice impersonation , and potential misuse in explicit content . [ 118 ] Ruby Innes of Kotaku Australia wrote that \"this practice could potentially put voice actors out of work considering you could just use their AI voice rather than getting them to voice act for a project and paying them.\" [ 12 ] In her coverage of the Voiceverse controversy, Edith Wakelin-King of Checkpoint Gaming raised the concern that \"this kind of technology has the potential to push voice actors out of work if it becomes easier and cheaper to use AI voices instead of working with the actor directly.\" [ 29 ] While 15.ai limited its scope to fictional characters and did not reproduce voices of real people or celebrities, [ 51 ] computer scientist Andrew Ng commented that similar technology could be used to do so, including for nefarious purposes. [ 50 ] In his 2020 assessment of 15.ai, Ng outlined potential \"enormously productive\" applications of voice cloning, such as revolutionizing the use of virtual actors in Hollywood , enabling voice actors to participate in more cartoon and audiobook productions, and allowing content creators to use synthetic celebrity voices to narrate their scripts. [ 50 ] However, he also cautioned that synthesizing a human's voice without consent raises ethical concerns and potential legal issues, and further warned that it could be maliciously exploited to impersonate private individuals. [ 50 ] Legacy [ edit ] External videos January 15, 2021 CNN broadcast showing a viral video that used 15.ai to replace Donald Trump's Home Alone 2 cameo with the Heavy Weapons Guy from Team Fortress 2 (occurs at ~1:16 in) [ 119 ] 15.ai was an early pioneer of audio deepfakes, and its popularity led to the emergence of AI speech synthesis-based memes during the initial stages of the AI boom in 2020. 15.ai is credited as the first platform to popularize AI voice cloning in Internet memes and content creation , [ a ] particularly through its ability to generate convincing character voices in real-time without requiring extensive technical expertise. [ 120 ] The platform's impact was especially large in fan communities, such as the My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic , Portal , Team Fortress 2 , and SpongeBob SquarePants fandoms, where it enabled the creation of viral content that garnered millions of views on social media. [ 121 ] Team Fortress 2 content creators also used the platform to produce both short-form memes and complex narrative animations using Source Filmmaker . Fan creations included skits and fan animations , [ 122 ] crossover content , [ 123 ] recreations of viral videos , [ 124 ] adaptations of fan fiction , [ 44 ] music videos, and musical compositions. [ 44 ] Some fan creations gained mainstream attention: a viral video that replaced Donald Trump 's cameo in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York with the Heavy Weapons Guy 's AI-generated voice was featured on a daytime CNN segment in January 2021. [ 119 ] Another noted creation was a 17-minute fan-made episode of Friendship Is Magic titled \"The Tax Breaks\", which was produced using 15.ai's character voices. [ 44 ] Some users integrated 15.ai with voice command software to create virtual assistants . [ 125 ] External videos May 13, 2022 \"The Tax Breaks\", a 17-minute fan-made episode of Friendship Is Magic produced using character voices from 15.ai [ 44 ] Its influence since its launch has been publicly recognized, with commercial alternatives like ElevenLabs [ c ] and Speechify emerging to fill the void after its initial shutdown. [ 127 ] Multiple contemporary generative voice AI companies have acknowledged 15.ai's pioneering role. [ 109 ] 15.ai established technical precedents that influenced subsequent developments in AI voice synthesis. Its integration of DeepMoji for emotional analysis demonstrated the viability of incorporating sentiment-aware speech generation, [ 128 ] while its support for ARPABET phonetic transcriptions set a standard for precise pronunciation control in public-facing voice synthesis tools. [ 42 ] The platform's multi-speaker model, which enabled simultaneous training of diverse character voices, allowed the system to recognize emotional patterns across different voices even when certain emotions were absent from individual character training sets. [ 91 ] 15.ai also contributed to the reduction of training data requirements for speech synthesis. Contemporary models like Tacotron 2 required tens of hours of audio to produce acceptable results and failed to generate intelligible speech with less than 24 minutes of training data. [ 39 ] In contrast, 15.ai demonstrated the ability to generate speech with substantially less training data; the name \"15.ai\" refers to the creator's statement that a voice can be cloned with just 15 seconds of data. [ 42 ] The 15-second benchmark became a reference point for subsequent voice synthesis systems; the original statement that only 15 seconds of data is required to clone a human's voice was corroborated by OpenAI in 2024.

It is powered by the large language model (LLM) of the same name , after previously being based on LaMDA and PaLM 2 . The Gemini architecture is trained natively on multiple data types, allowing the models to process and generate text, computer code, images, audio, and video simultaneously. Google distributes the technology in varying capacities, ranging from efficient on-device versions (\"Nano\") and cost-effective, high-throughput variants (\"Flash\") to high-compute models designed for complex reasoning (\"Pro\" and \"Ultra\"). The 1.5 and 3.0 model generations introduced extended context windows, enabling the analysis of large datasets such as entire codebases, long-form videos, or extensive document archives in a single prompt. Gemini was first announced on December 6, 2023, and replaced existing Google branding for AI services. In February 2024, the Bard chatbot was renamed Gemini, and the \"Duet AI\" branding for Google Cloud and Workspace was retired in favor of the Gemini identifier. The models integrate into the Google ecosystem through the Gemini mobile app, which functions as an overlay assistant on Android devices, and through the Vertex AI platform for third-party developers. The release of Gemini has generated technical praise and public controversy. Commentators have highlighted the models' benchmarks in coding and retrieval tasks as competitive with OpenAI 's GPT-4 and GPT-5 . However, the product launch faced criticism regarding the reliability of its outputs. In early 2024, Google suspended the model's ability to generate images of people after users reported historical inaccuracies and bias in its depictions of human subjects. Subsequent updates, including the Gemini 1.5 and 3.0 series released throughout 2025, focused on reducing hallucinations , improving latency, and enhancing agentic capabilities for autonomous research and software development. History [ edit ] Background [ edit ] Further information: LaMDA § History Google co-founders Sergey Brin ( L ) and Larry Page ( R ) were summoned out of retirement to discuss Google's response to OpenAI 's ChatGPT . In November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT , a chatbot based on the GPT-3 family of large language models (LLMs). [ 10 ] [ 11 ] ChatGPT gained worldwide attention, becoming a viral Internet sensation . [ 12 ] Alarmed by ChatGPT's potential threat to Google Search , Google executives issued a \"code red\" alert, reassigning several teams to assist in the company's artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. [ 13 ] Sundar Pichai , the CEO of Google and parent company Alphabet , was widely reported to have issued the alert, but Pichai later denied this to The New York Times . [ 14 ] In a rare move, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin , who had stepped down from their roles as co-CEOs of Alphabet in 2019, attended emergency meetings with company executives to discuss Google's response to ChatGPT. [ 15 ] Brin requested access to Google's code in February 2023, for the first time in years. [ 16 ] Google had unveiled LaMDA , a prototype LLM, earlier in 2021, [ 17 ] [ 18 ] but it was not released to the public. [ 19 ] When asked by employees at an all-hands meeting whether LaMDA was a missed opportunity for Google to compete with ChatGPT, Pichai and Google AI chief Jeff Dean said that while the company's chatbot had similar capabilities to ChatGPT, there were risks to introducing an LLM that might spread false information, so they decided to wait. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] In January 2023, Google Brain 's sister company DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis hinted at plans for a ChatGPT rival, [ 22 ] and Google employees were instructed to accelerate progress on a ChatGPT competitor, intensively testing \"Apprentice Bard\" and other chatbots. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Pichai assured investors during Google's quarterly earnings investor call in February that the company had plans to expand LaMDA's availability and applications. [ 25 ] Bard [ edit ] Announcement [ edit ] On February 6, 2023, Google announced Bard, a generative artificial intelligence chatbot powered by LaMDA. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Bard was first rolled out to a select group of 10,000 \"trusted testers\", [ 29 ] before a wide release scheduled at the end of the month. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The project was overseen by product lead Jack Krawczyk, who described the product as a \"collaborative AI service\" rather than a search engine , [ 30 ] [ 31 ] while Pichai detailed how Bard would be integrated into Google Search. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Reuters calculated that adding ChatGPT-like features to Google Search could cost the company $6 billion in additional expenses by 2024, while research and consulting firm SemiAnalysis calculated that it would cost Google $3 billion. [ 32 ] The technology was developed under the codename \"Atlas\", [ 33 ] with the name \"Bard\" in reference to the Celtic term for a storyteller and chosen to \"reflect the creative nature of the algorithm underneath\". [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Multiple media outlets and financial analysts described Google as \"rushing\" Bard's announcement to preempt rival Microsoft 's planned February 7 event unveiling its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its Bing search engine in the form of Bing AI (later rebranded as Microsoft Copilot ), [ 36 ] [ 37 ] as well as to avoid playing \"catch-up\" to Microsoft. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told The Verge : \"I want people to know that we made them dance.\" [ 41 ] Tom Warren of The Verge and Davey Alba of Bloomberg News noted that this marked the beginning of another clash between the two Big Tech companies over \"the future of search\", after their six-year \"truce\" expired in 2021; [ 36 ] [ 42 ] Chris Stokel-Walker of The Guardian , Sara Morrison of Recode , and analyst Dan Ives of investment firm Wedbush Securities labeled this an AI arms race between the two. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] After an \"underwhelming\" February 8 livestream in Paris showcasing Bard, Google's stock fell eight percent, equivalent to a $100 billion loss in market value , and the YouTube video of the livestream was made private. [ 38 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Many viewers also pointed out an error during the demo in which Bard gives inaccurate information about the James Webb Space Telescope in response to a query. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Google employees criticized Pichai's \"rushed\" and \"botched\" announcement of Bard on Memegen, the company's internal forum, [ 50 ] while Maggie Harrison of Futurism called the rollout \"chaos\". Pichai defended his actions by saying that Google had been \"deeply working on AI for a long time\", rejecting the notion that Bard's launch was a knee-jerk reaction . [ 51 ] A week after the Paris livestream, Pichai had 80,000 employees dedicate two to four hours to dogfood testing Bard, [ 52 ] while Google executive Prabhakar Raghavan had employees correct any errors Bard made. [ 53 ] [ 29 ] In the following weeks, Google employees criticized Bard in internal messages, citing safety and ethical concerns and calling on company leaders not to launch the service. Google executives launched the product, overruling a negative risk assessment report conducted by its AI ethics team. [ 54 ] After Pichai suddenly laid off 12,000 employees later that month due to slowing revenue growth, remaining workers shared memes and snippets of their humorous exchanges with Bard soliciting its \"opinion\" on the layoffs. [ 55 ] Google employees began testing a more sophisticated version of Bard with larger parameters, dubbed \"Big Bard\", in mid-March. [ 56 ] Launch [ edit ] The logo for Bard (21 March 2023 - 7 February 2024) Google opened up early access for Bard on March 21, 2023, in a limited capacity, allowing users in the US and the UK to join a waitlist. Unlike Microsoft's approach with Bing Chat, Bard was launched as a standalone web application featuring a text box and a disclaimer that the chatbot \"may display inaccurate or offensive information that doesn't represent Google's views\". Three responses are then provided to each question, with users prompted to submit feedback on the usefulness of each answer. Google vice presidents Sissie Hsiao and Eli Collins framed Bard as a complement to Google Search and stated that the company had not determined how to make the service profitable. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Among those granted early access were those enrolled in Google's \"Pixel Superfans\" loyalty program , [ 60 ] users of its Pixel and Nest devices, and Google One subscribers. [ 61 ] Bard is trained by third-party contractors hired by Google, including Appen and Accenture workers, whom Business Insider and Bloomberg News reported were placed under extreme pressure, overworked, and underpaid. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Bard is also trained on data from publicly available sources, which Google disclosed by amending its privacy policy . [ 64 ] Shortly after Bard's initial launch, Google reorganized the team behind Google Assistant , the company's virtual assistant , to focus on Bard instead. [ 65 ] Google researcher Jacob Devlin resigned from the company after claiming that Bard had surreptitiously leveraged data from ChatGPT; [ 66 ] Google denied the allegations. [ 67 ] Meanwhile, a senior software engineer at the company published an internal memo warning that Google was falling behind in the AI \"arms race\", not to OpenAI but to independent researchers in open-source communities. [ 68 ] Pichai revealed on March 31 that the company intended to \"upgrade\" Bard by basing it on PaLM , a newer and more powerful LLM from Google, rather than LaMDA. [ 69 ] The same day, Krawczyk announced that Google had added \"math and logic capabilities\" to Bard. [ 70 ] Bard gained the ability to assist in coding in April, being compatible with more than 20 programming languages at launch. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Microsoft also began running advertisements in the address bar of a developer build of the Edge browser, urging users to try Bing whenever they visit the Bard web app. [ 73 ] 9to5Google reported that Google was working to integrate Bard into its ChromeOS operating system and Pixel devices. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] Updates [ edit ] Bard took center stage during the annual Google I/O keynote in May 2023, [ 76 ] with Pichai and Hsiao announcing a series of updates to Bard, including the adoption of PaLM 2, integration with other Google products and third-party services, expansion to 180 countries, support for additional languages, and new features. [ 77 ] In stark contrast to previous years, the Google Assistant was barely mentioned during the event. [ 76 ] The expanded rollout did not include any nations in the European Union (EU), possibly reflecting concerns about compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation . [ 78 ] Those with Google Workspace accounts also gained access to the service. [ 79 ] In June, Google attempted to launch Bard in the EU but was blocked by the Irish Data Protection Commission , who requested a \"data protection impact assessment\" from the company. [ 80 ] In July, Bard was launched in the EU and Brazil, adding support for dozens of new languages and introducing personalization and productivity features. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] An invite-only chatroom (\" server \") on Discord was created in July, consisting of users who heavily used Bard. Over the next few months, the chatroom was flooded with comments questioning the usefulness of Bard. [ 83 ] Google released a major update to the chatbot in September, integrating it into many of its products through \"extensions\", adding a button to attempt to fact-check AI-generated responses through Google Search, and allowing users to share conversation threads. [ 84 ] Google also introduced the \"Google-Extended\" web crawler as part of its search engine's robots.txt indexing file to allow web publishers to opt-out of allowing Bard to scan them for training. [ 85 ] Online users later discovered that Google Search was indexing Bard conversation threads on which users had enabled sharing; Google stated that this was an error which was corrected. [ 86 ] In October, during the company's annual Made by Google event, Hsiao unveiled \"Assistant with Bard\", an upgraded version of the Google Assistant which was integrated with Bard. [ 87 ] When the U.S. Copyright Office solicited public comment on potential new regulation on generative AI technologies, Google joined with OpenAI and Microsoft in arguing that the responsibility for generating copyrighted material lay with the user, not the developer. [ 88 ] Accenture contractors voted to join the Alphabet Workers Union in November, in protest of suboptimal working conditions, [ 89 ] while the company filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against a group of unidentified scammers who had been advertising malware disguised as a downloadable version of Bard. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Gemini [ edit ] Rebranding [ edit ] App and Favicon in 2025 ... ... and in 2023-2025 [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Further information: Gemini (language model) § History Screenshot of Gemini on an Android device On December 6, 2023, Google announced Gemini , a larger, multimodal LLM. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] A specially tuned version of the mid-tier Gemini Pro was integrated into Bard, while the larger Gemini Ultra was used for \"Bard Advanced\" in 2024. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] The Wall Street Journal reported that Bard was then averaging around 220 million monthly visitors. [ 99 ] Google ended its contract with Appen in January 2024, [ 100 ] while image generation was added to Bard the next month, using Google Brain's Imagen 2 text-to-image model . [ 101 ] On February 8, 2024, Bard and Duet AI were unified under the Gemini brand, with a mobile app launched on Android and the service integrated into the Google app on iOS . On Android, users who downloaded the app saw Gemini replace Assistant as their device's default virtual assistant, though Assistant remained a standalone service. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Google also launched \"Gemini Advanced with Ultra 1.0\", available via a \"Google One AI Premium\" subscription, [ 104 ] incorporated Gemini into its Messages app on Android, [ 105 ] [ 106 ] and announced a partnership with Stack Overflow . [ 107 ] [ 108 ] Gemini again took center stage at the 2024 Google I/O keynote. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Google announced that Gemini would be integrated into several products, including Android, Chrome , Photos , and Workspace. [ 109 ] Gemini Advanced was upgraded to the \"Gemini 1.5 Pro\" language model, with Google previewing Gemini Live, a voice chat mode, and Gems, the ability to create custom chatbots. [ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ] Further updates [ edit ] See also: Nano Banana Originally introduced by Google in August 2024, Gemini Live debuted on the Pixel 9 series later that year as the default virtual assistant, replacing the Google Assistant on those devices. It was later rolled out to Samsung Galaxy devices beginning with the Galaxy S25 series in July 2025, [ 114 ] [ 115 ] and subsequently expanded to models like the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 , where it became part of the Galaxy AI suite. [ 116 ] In February 2025, Google introduced a feature for Gemini Advanced subscribers that can recall and reference past chats. [ 117 ] In June 2025, Google announced Gemini CLI [ 118 ] , which is an open-source AI tool for terminals. [ 119 ] At the same time, Google unveiled a new logo of Gemini that align its colors with color schemes used by the new gradient Google logo , with more rounded sparkles than the previous logo. [ 120 ] The new logo is available for Android and iPhone devices. [ 121 ] Reception [ edit ] Early responses [ edit ] Gemini received mixed reviews upon its initial release in March 2023. [ 122 ] James Vincent of The Verge found it faster than ChatGPT and Bing Chat, but noted that the lack of Bing-esque footnotes was \"both a blessing and a curse\", [ 59 ] encouraging Google to be bolder when experimenting with AI. [ 123 ] His colleague David Pierce was unimpressed by its uninteresting and sometimes inaccurate responses, [ 124 ] adding that despite Google's insistence that Gemini was not a search engine, its user interface resembled that of one, which could cause problems for Google. [ 125 ] Cade Metz of The New York Times described Gemini as \"more cautious\" than ChatGPT, [ 126 ] while Shirin Ghaffary of Vox called it \"dry and uncontroversial\" due to the reserved nature of its responses. [ 127 ] The Washington Post columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler found Gemini a mixed bag, noting that it acted cautiously but could show Internet-influenced bias. [ 128 ] Writing for ZDNET , Sabrina Ortiz believed ChatGPT and Bing Chat were \"more capable overall\" in comparison to Gemini, [ 129 ] while Wired journalist Lauren Goode found her conversation with Gemini \"the most bizarre\" of the three. [ 130 ] After the introduction of extensions, The New York Times ' Kevin Roose found the update underwhelming and \"a bit of a mess\", [ 131 ] while Business Insider 's Lakshmi Varanasi found that Gemini often leaned more into flattery than facts. [ 132 ] In a 60 Minutes conversation with Hsiao, Google senior vice president James Manyika , and Pichai, CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley found Gemini \"unsettling\". [ 133 ] Associate professor Ethan Mollick of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania was underwhelmed by its artistic ineptitude. [ 134 ] The New York Times conducted a test with ChatGPT and Gemini regarding their ability to handle tasks expected of human assistants, and concluded that ChatGPT's performance was vastly superior to that of Gemini. [ 135 ] NewsGuard , a tool that rates the credibility of news articles, found that Gemini was more skilled at debunking known conspiracy theories than ChatGPT. [ 136 ] A report published by the Associated Press cautioned that Gemini and other chatbots were prone to generate \"false and misleading information that threaten[ed] to disenfranchise voters\". [ 137 ] Image generation controversy [ edit ] See also: Artificial intelligence controversies Gemini's response when asked to \"generate a picture of a U.S. senator from the 1800s\" in February 2024, as shown by The Verge [ 138 ] In February 2024, social media users reported that Gemini was generating images that featured people of color and women in historically inaccurate contexts—such as Vikings , Nazi soldiers , and the Founding Fathers —and refusing prompts to generate images of white people. These images were derided on social media, including by conservatives who cited them as evidence of Google's \" wokeness \". [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] The business magnate Elon Musk , whose company xAI operates the chatbot Grok , was among those who criticized Google, denouncing its suite of products as biased and racist. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] Musk and other users targeted Krawczyk, resurfacing his past comments discussing race, [ 142 ] [ 143 ] leading Krawczyk to withdraw from X and LinkedIn . [ 144 ] The conservative-leaning tabloid New York Post ran a cover story on the incident in the print edition of its newspaper. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] In response, Krawczyk said that Google was \"working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately\", and Google paused Gemini's ability to generate images of people. [ 147 ] [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Raghavan released a lengthy statement addressing the controversy, explaining that Gemini had \"overcompensate[d]\" amid its efforts to strive for diversity and acknowledging that the images were \"embarrassing and wrong\". [ 150 ] [ 151 ] [ 152 ] In an internal memo to employees, Pichai called the debacle offensive and unacceptable, promising structural and technical changes. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] [ 155 ] Several employees in Google's trust and safety team were laid off days later. [ 156 ] [ 157 ] Hassabis stated that Gemini's ability to generate images of people would be restored within two weeks; [ 158 ] [ 159 ] [ 160 ] it was ultimately relaunched in late August, powered by its new Imagen 3 model. [ 161 ] [ 162 ] The market reacted negatively, with Google's stock falling by 4.4 percent. [ 163 ] Pichai faced growing calls to resign, including from technology analysts Ben Thompson and Om Malik . [ 164 ] [ 165 ] [ 166 ] House Republicans led by Jim Jordan subpoenaed Google, accusing the company of colluding with the Biden administration to censor speech. [ 167 ] [ 168 ] In light of the fiasco and Google's overall response to OpenAI, Business Insider 's Hugh Langley and Lara O'Reilly declared that Google was fast going \"from vanguard to dinosaur\". [ 169 ] Bloomberg columnist Parmy Olson suggested that Google's \"rushed\" rollout of Gemini was the cause of its woes, not \"wokeness\". [ 170 ] Martin Peers, writing for The Information , opined that Google needed a leader like Mark Zuckerberg to defuse the situation. [ 171 ] Hugging Face scientist Sasha Luccioni and Surrey University professor Alan Woodward believed that the incident had \"deeply embedded\" roots in Gemini's training corpus and algorithms, making it difficult to rectify. [ 172 ] Jeremy Kahn of Fortune called for researchers focused on safety and responsibility to work together to develop better guardrails. [ 173 ] New York magazine contributor John Herrman wrote: \"It's a spectacular unforced error, a slapstick rake-in-the-face moment, and a testament to how panicked Google must be by the rise of OpenAI and the threat of AI to its search business.\" [ 174 ] Advertisements [ edit ] During the 2024 Summer Olympics in July, Google aired a commercial for Gemini entitled \"Dear Sydney\" depicting a father asking the chatbot to generate a fan letter to the star athlete Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone for his young daughter. Similar to Apple 's \" Crush! \" commercial for the seventh-generation iPad Pro , the advertisement drew heavy backlash online, with criticism for replacing authentic human expression and creativity with a computer; [ 175 ] [ 176 ] [ 177 ] The Washington Post columnist Alexandra Petri lambasted the commercial as \"missing the point\". [ 178 ] As a result, Google withdrew the commercial from NBC 's rotation. [ 179 ] [ 180 ] Google aired two commercials during Super Bowl LIX in February 2025, both promoting Gemini. The first, entitled \"50 States, 50 Stories\", consisted of a national spot and 50 regional spots showcasing how small businesses in each U.S. state leverage Gemini in Google Workspace. [ 181 ] [ 182 ] Social media users noticed a factual error in Wisconsin 's spot regarding gouda cheese , prompting Google to edit out the incorrect statistic, [ 183 ] [ 184 ] [ 185 ] while The Verge claimed that Google had \"faked\" some of Gemini's output in the same commercial by plagiarizing text on the web. [ 186 ] [ 187 ] [ 188 ] Garett Sloane of Ad Age commented that these blunders illustrated the risks of advertising AI technology. [ 189 ] The other commercial was entitled \"Dream Job\" and featured a father using Gemini on his Pixel 9 to prepare for a job interview; Google also ran a third commercial entitled \"Party Blitz\" online, in which a man \"attempts to impress his girlfriend's family by using Gemini [on his Pixel 9] to become a football expert\". [ 190 ] [ 191 ] [ 192 ] In 2022, McLaren Racing announced a multi-year partnership with Google. [ 193 ] As part of Google's partnership extension with McLaren in 2024, [ 194 ] Gemini was advertised on the McLaren Formula One car, [ 195 ] including racing a special livery based on Gemini's color palette for the 2025 United States Grand Prix . [ 196 ] Other incidents [ edit ] In the aftermath of the image generation controversy, some users began accusing Gemini's text responses of being biased toward the political left . In one such example that circulated online, Gemini said that it was \"difficult to say definitively\" whether Musk or the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler had more negatively affected society. [ 197 ] [ 159 ] Other users reported that Gemini tended to promote left-wing politicians and causes such as affirmative action and abortion rights while refusing to promote right-wing figures, meat consumption , and fossil fuels . [ 165 ] [ 198 ] [ 199 ] The Wall Street Journal 's editorial board wrote that Gemini's \"apparently ingrained woke biases\" were \"fueling a backlash toward AI on the political right, which is joining the left in calling for more regulation .\" [ 200 ] Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology junior minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar alleged that Google had violated the country's Information Technology Rules by refusing to summarize an article by the right-wing news website OpIndia , [ 201 ] and for saying that some experts described Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's policies as fascist. [ 202 ] In France, Google was fined €250 million by the competition regulator Autorité de la concurrence under the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market , in part due to its cited failure to inform local news publishers of when their content was used for Gemini's training. [ 203 ] Voice of America accused Gemini of \"parroting\" Chinese propaganda . [ 204 ] In November 2024, CBS News reported that Gemini had responded to a college student in Michigan asking for help with homework in a threatening manner, calling the student \"a burden on society\" and saying \"Please die. Please.\" A statement issued by Google said \"This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring.\" [ 205 ] See also [ edit ] Google AI Studio – Web-based IDE for prototyping with Google's generative AI models References [ edit ] ^ \"A new era of intelligence with Gemini 3\" .
